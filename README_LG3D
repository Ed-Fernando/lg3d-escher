This is the only way to build Escher that I have discovered.
I was unable to use ant with the build.xml file.

Note: you will need to use a javac compiler from the 1.4.2 J2SDK.
I use one from build 06 and this seems to work okay. This is what
I mean by $JAVAC below

(All of these commands assume that you are in the top-level 
lg3d-escher directory).

To compile:

% find gnu -name "*.java" | xargs $JAVAC

To build the jar:

% find gnu -name "*.class" | xargs jar -cM0f escher-0.2.2.lg.jar

To clean the workspace:

% find gnu -name "*.class" | xargs /bin/rm -f
