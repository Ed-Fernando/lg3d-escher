Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid

Escher is a collection of libraries for X Window System written purely
in Java. It consists of an X11 protocol implementation (similar to
xlib for C/C++), and its extensions such as GLX, the OpenGL rendering
protocol.


* How To Run

  Install JDK 1.3 (http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/linux130/).
  Inside the directory "escher-0.1.0" (or later version),

  $ xhost +localhost
  $ java gnu.x11.test.Hello --help
  $ java gnu.x11.test.Hello

  It will pop up an X window which says "Hello World!".

  $ etc/bin/jdemo gnu

  You will see a list of X applications and test suits you can run.
