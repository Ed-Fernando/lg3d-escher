       XCirculateRequestEvent - CirculateRequest event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>CirculateRequest</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* CirculateRequest */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window parent;
            Window window;
            int place;               /* PlaceOnTop, PlaceOnBottom */
       } XCirculateRequestEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The parent member is set to the parent window.  The window
       member is set to the subwindow to be restacked.  The place
       member is set to what the new position in the stacking
       order should be and is either <I>PlaceOnTop</I> or <I>PlaceOnBottom</I>.
       If it is <I>PlaceOnTop</I>, the subwindow should be on top of all
       siblings.  If it is <I>PlaceOnBottom</I>, the subwindow should be
       below all siblings.
