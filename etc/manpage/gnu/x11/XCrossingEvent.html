<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>EnterNotify</I> and <I>LeaveNotify</I> events con-
       tains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* EnterNotify or LeaveNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;           /* ``event'' window reported relative to */
            Window root;             /* root window that the event occurred on */
            Window subwindow;        /* child window */
            Time time;               /* milliseconds */
            int x, y;                /* pointer x, y coordinates in event window */
            int x_root, y_root;      /* coordinates relative to root */
            int mode;                /* NotifyNormal, NotifyGrab, NotifyUngrab */
            int detail;
                                     /*
                                     * NotifyAncestor, NotifyVirtual, NotifyInferior,
                                     * NotifyNonlinear,NotifyNonlinearVirtual
                                     */
            Bool same_screen;        /* same screen flag */
            Bool focus;              /* boolean focus */
            unsigned int state;      /* key or button mask */
       } XCrossingEvent;
       typedef XCrossingEvent XEnterWindowEvent;
       typedef XCrossingEvent XLeaveWindowEvent;

       When you receive these events, the structure members are
       set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the window on which the <I>Enter-</I>
       <I>Notify</I> or <I>LeaveNotify</I> event was generated and is referred
       to as the event window.  This is the window used by the X
       server to report the event, and is relative to the root
       window on which the event occurred.  The root member is
       the event window.  This position is always the pointer's
       final position, not its initial position.  If the event
       window is on the same screen as the root window, x and y
       are the pointer coordinates relative to the event window's
       origin.  Otherwise, x and y are set to zero.  The x_root
       and y_root members are set to the pointer's coordinates
       relative to the root window's origin at the time of the
       event.

       The same_screen member is set to indicate whether the
       event window is on the same screen as the root window and
       can be either <I>True</I> or <I>False</I>.  If <I>True</I>, the event and root
       windows are on the same screen.  If <I>False</I>, the event and
       root windows are not on the same screen.

       The focus member is set to indicate whether the event win-
       dow is the focus window or an inferior of the focus win-
       dow.  The X server can set this member to either <I>True</I> or
       <I>False</I>.  If <I>True</I>, the event window is the focus window or
       an inferior of the focus window.  If <I>False</I>, the event win-
       dow is not the focus window or an inferior of the focus
       window.

       The state member is set to indicate the state of the
       pointer buttons and modifier keys just prior to the event.
       The X server can set this member to the bitwise inclusive
       OR of one or more of the button or modifier key masks:
       <I>Button1Mask</I>, <I>Button2Mask</I>, <I>Button3Mask</I>, <I>Button4Mask</I>,
       <I>Button5Mask</I>, <I>ShiftMask</I>, <I>LockMask</I>, <I>ControlMask</I>, <I>Mod1Mask</I>,
       <I>Mod2Mask</I>, <I>Mod3Mask</I>, <I>Mod4Mask</I>, <I>Mod5Mask</I>.

       The mode member is set to indicate whether the events are
       normal events, pseudo-motion events when a grab activates,
       or pseudo-motion events when a grab deactivates.  The X
       server can set this member to <I>NotifyNormal</I>, <I>NotifyGrab</I>, or
       <I>NotifyUngrab</I>.

       The detail member is set to indicate the notify detail and
       can be <I>NotifyAncestor</I>, <I>NotifyVirtual</I>, <I>NotifyInferior</I>,
       <I>NotifyNonlinear</I>, or <I>NotifyNonlinearVirtual</I>.
