       XDestroyWindowEvent - DestroyNotify event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>DestroyNotify</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* DestroyNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window event;
            Window window;
       } XDestroyWindowEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The event member is set either to the destroyed window or
       to its parent, depending on whether <I>StructureNotify</I> or
       <I>SubstructureNotify</I> was selected.  The window member is set
       to the window that is destroyed.
