       XExposeEvent - Expose event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>Expose</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* Expose */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;
            int x, y;
            int width, height;
            int count;               /* if nonzero, at least this many more */
       } XExposeEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the exposed (damaged) window.
       The x and y members are set to the coordinates relative to
       the window's origin and indicate the upper-left corner of
       the rectangle.  The width and height members are set to
       the size (extent) of the rectangle.  The count member is
       set to the number of <I>Expose</I> events that are to follow.  If
       count is zero, no more <I>Expose</I> events follow for this win-
       dow.  However, if count is nonzero, at least that number
       of <I>Expose</I> events (and possibly more) follow for this win-
       dow.  Simple applications that do not want to optimize
       redisplay by distinguishing between subareas of its window
       can just ignore all <I>Expose</I> events with nonzero counts and
       perform full redisplays on events with zero counts.
