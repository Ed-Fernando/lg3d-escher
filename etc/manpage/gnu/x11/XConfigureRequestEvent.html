       XConfigureRequestEvent - ConfigureRequest event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>ConfigureRequest</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* ConfigureRequest */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window parent;
            Window window;
            int x, y;
            int width, height;
            int border_width;
            Window above;
            int detail;              /* Above, Below, TopIf, BottomIf, Opposite */
            unsigned long value_mask;
       } XConfigureRequestEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The parent member is set to the parent window.  The window
       member is set to the window whose size, position, border
       width, and/or stacking order is to be reconfigured.  The
       value_mask member indicates which components were speci-
       fied in the <I>ConfigureWindow</I> protocol request.  The corre-
       sponding values are reported as given in the request.  The
       remaining values are filled in from the current geometry
       of the window, except in the case of above (sibling) and
       detail (stack-mode), which are reported as <I>None</I> and <I>Above</I>,
       respectively, if they are not given in the request.
