       XDestroyWindow, XDestroySubwindows - destroy windows


</PRE>
<H2>SYNTAX</H2><PRE>
       XDestroyWindow(<I>display</I>, <I>w</I>)
             Display *<I>display</I>;
             Window <I>w</I>;

       XDestroySubwindows(<I>display</I>, <I>w</I>)
             Display *<I>display</I>;
             Window <I>w</I>;


</PRE>
<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2><PRE>
       <I>display</I>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>w</I>         Specifies the window.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <I>XDestroyWindow</I> function destroys the specified window
       as well as all of its subwindows and causes the X server
       to generate a <I>DestroyNotify</I> event for each window.  The
       window should never be referenced again.  If the window
       specified by the w argument is mapped, it is unmapped
       automatically.  The ordering of the <I>DestroyNotify</I> events
       is such that for any given window being destroyed,
       <I>DestroyNotify</I> is generated on any inferiors of the window
       before being generated on the window itself.  The ordering
       among siblings and across subhierarchies is not otherwise
       constrained.  If the window you specified is a root win-
       dow, no windows are destroyed.  Destroying a mapped window
       will generate <I>Expose</I> events on other windows that were
       obscured by the window being destroyed.

       <I>XDestroyWindow</I> can generate a <I>BadWindow</I> error.

       The <I>XDestroySubwindows</I> function destroys all inferior win-
       dows of the specified window, in bottom-to-top stacking
       order.  It causes the X server to generate a <I>DestroyNotify</I>
       event for each window.  If any mapped subwindows were
       actually destroyed, <I>XDestroySubwindows</I> causes the X server
       to generate <I>Expose</I> events on the specified window.  This
       is much more efficient than deleting many windows one at a
       time because much of the work need be performed only once
       for all of the windows, rather than for each window.  The
       subwindows should never be referenced again.

       <I>XDestroySubwindows</I> can generate a <I>BadWindow</I> error.


</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       <I>BadWindow</I> A value for a Window argument does not name a
                 defined Window.
