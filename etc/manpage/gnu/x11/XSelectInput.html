</PRE>
<H2>SYNTAX</H2><PRE>
       XSelectInput(<I>display</I>, <I>w</I>, <I>event</I><B>_</B><I>mask</I>)
             Display *<I>display</I>;
             Window <I>w</I>;
             long <I>event</I><B>_</B><I>mask</I>;


</PRE>
<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2><PRE>
       <I>display</I>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>event</I><B>_</B><I>mask</I>
                 Specifies the event mask.

       <I>w</I>         Specifies the window whose events you are inter-
                 ested in.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <I>XSelectInput</I> function requests that the X server
       report the events associated with the specified event
       mask.  Initially, X will not report any of these events.
       Events are reported relative to a window.  If a window is
       not interested in a device event, it usually propagates to
       the closest ancestor that is interested, unless the
       do_not_propagate mask prohibits it.

       Setting the event-mask attribute of a window overrides any
       previous call for the same window but not for other
       clients.  Multiple clients can select for the same events
       on the same window with the following restrictions:

       <B>o</B>    Multiple clients can select events on the same window
            because their event masks are disjoint.  When the X
            server generates an event, it reports it to all
            interested clients.

       <B>o</B>    Only one client at a time can select
            <I>CirculateRequest</I>, <I>ConfigureRequest</I>, or <I>MapRequest</I>
            events, which are associated with the event mask
            <I>SubstructureRedirectMask</I>.

       <B>o</B>    Only one client at a time can select a <I>ResizeRequest</I>
            event, which is associated with the event mask
            <I>ResizeRedirectMask</I>.

       <B>o</B>    Only one client at a time can select a <I>ButtonPress</I>
            event, which is associated with the event mask
            <I>ButtonPressMask</I>.

       The server reports the event to all interested clients.

       <I>XSelectInput</I> can generate a <I>BadWindow</I> error.
