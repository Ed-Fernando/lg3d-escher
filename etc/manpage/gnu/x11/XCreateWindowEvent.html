       XCreateWindowEvent - CreateNotify event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>CreateNotify</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* CreateNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window parent;           /* parent of the window */
            Window window;           /* window id of window created */
            int x, y;                /* window location */
            int width, height;       /* size of window */
            int border_width;        /* border width */
            Bool override_redirect;  /* creation should be overridden */
       } XCreateWindowEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The parent member is set to the created window's parent.
       The window member specifies the created window.  The x and
       y members are set to the created window's coordinates rel-
       ative to the parent window's origin and indicate the posi-
       tion of the upper-left outside corner of the created win-
       dow.  The width and height members are set to the inside
       size of the created window (not including the border) and
       are always nonzero.  The border_width member is set to the
       width of the created window's border, in pixels.  The
       override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect
       attribute of the window.  Window manager clients normally
       should ignore this window if the override_redirect member
       is <I>True</I>.
