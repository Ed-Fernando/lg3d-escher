       XMapEvent, XMappingEvent - MapNotify and MappingNotify
       event structures


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>MapNotify</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* MapNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window event;
            Window window;
            Bool override_redirect;  /* boolean, is override set... */
       } XMapEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The event member is set either to the window that was
       mapped or to its parent, depending on whether <I>StructureNo-</I>
       <I>tify</I> or <I>SubstructureNotify</I> was selected.  The window mem-
       ber is set to the window that was mapped.  The over-
       ride_redirect member is set to the override-redirect
       attribute of the window.  Window manager clients normally
       should ignore this window if the override-redirect
       attribute is <I>True</I>, because these events usually are gener-
       ated from pop-ups, which override structure control.

       The structure for <I>MappingNotify</I> events is:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* MappingNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;           /* unused */
            int request;             /* one of MappingModifier, MappingKeyboard,
                                        MappingPointer */

       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The request member is set to indicate the kind of mapping
       change that occurred and can be <I>MappingModifier</I>,
       <I>MappingKeyboard</I>, <I>MappingPointer</I>.  If it is
       <I>MappingModifier</I>, the modifier mapping was changed.  If it
       is <I>MappingKeyboard</I>, the keyboard mapping was changed.  If
       it is <I>MappingPointer</I>, the pointer button mapping was
       changed.  The first_keycode and count members are set only
       if the request member was set to <I>MappingKeyboard</I>.  The
       number in first_keycode represents the first number in the
       range of the altered mapping, and count represents the
       number of keycodes altered.
