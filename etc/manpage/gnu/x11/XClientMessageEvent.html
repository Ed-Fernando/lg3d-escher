       XClientMessageEvent - ClientMessage event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>ClientMessage</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* ClientMessage */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;
            Atom message_type;
            int format;
            union {
                 char b[20];
                 short s[10];
                 long l[5];
                    } data;
       } XClientMessageEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The message_type member is set to an atom that indicates
       how the data should be interpreted by the receiving
       client.  The format member is set to 8, 16, or 32 and
       specifies whether the data should be viewed as a list of
       bytes, shorts, or longs.  The data member is a union that
       contains the members b, s, and l.  The b, s, and l members
       represent data of twenty 8-bit values, ten 16-bit values,
       and five 32-bit values.  Particular message types might
       not make use of all these values.  The X server places no
       interpretation on the values in the window, message_type,
       or data members.
