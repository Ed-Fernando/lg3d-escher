<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <I>XrmGetFileDatabase</I> function opens the specified file,
       creates a new resource database, and loads it with the
       specifications read in from the specified file.  The spec-
       ified file should contain a sequence of entries in valid
       ResourceLine format (see section 15.1); the database that
       results from reading a file with incorrect syntax is
       implementation-dependent.  The file is parsed in the cur-
       rent locale, and the database is created in the current
       locale.  If it cannot open the specified file, <I>XrmGetFile-</I>
       The <I>XrmGetStringDatabase</I> function creates a new database
       and stores the resources specified in the specified null-
       terminated string.  <I>XrmGetStringDatabase</I> is similar to
       <I>XrmGetFileDatabase</I> except that it reads the information
       out of a string instead of out of a file.  The string
       should contain a sequence of entries in valid ResourceLine
       format (see section 15.1) terminated by a null character;
       the database that results from using a string with incor-
       rect syntax is implementation-dependent.  The string is
       parsed in the current locale, and the database is created
       in the current locale.

       If database is NULL, <I>XrmDestroyDatabase</I> returns immedi-
       ately.

       The <I>XrmLocaleOfDatabase</I> function returns the name of the
       locale bound to the specified database, as a null-termi-
       nated string.  The returned locale name string is owned by
       Xlib and should not be modified or freed by the client.
       Xlib is not permitted to free the string until the
       database is destroyed.  Until the string is freed, it will
       not be modified by Xlib.

       The <I>XrmGetDatabase</I> function returns the database associ-
       ated with the specified display.  It returns NULL if a
       database has not yet been set.

       The <I>XrmSetDatabase</I> function associates the specified
       resource database (or NULL) with the specified display.
       The database previously associated with the display (if
       any) is not destroyed.  A client or toolkit may find this
       function convenient for retaining a database once it is
       constructed.

<H2>FILE SYNTAX</H2><PRE>
       The syntax of a resource file is a sequence of resource
       lines terminated by newline characters or the end of the
       file.  The syntax of an individual resource line is:

       ResourceLine   = Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | &lt;empty line&gt;
       Comment        = "!" {&lt;any character except null or newline&gt;}
       IncludeFile    = "#" WhiteSpace "include" WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
       FileName       = &lt;valid filename for operating system&gt;
       ResourceSpec   = WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ":" WhiteSpace Value
       ResourceName   = [Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
       Binding        = "." | "*"
       WhiteSpace     = {&lt;space&gt; | &lt;horizontal tab&gt;}
       Component      = "?" | ComponentName
       ComponentName  = NameChar {NameChar}
       NameChar       = "a"-"z" | "A"-"Z" | "0"-"9" | "_" | "-"
       Value          = {&lt;any character except null or unescaped newline&gt;}

       more Binding characters, the sequence will be replaced
       with single ``.'' character if the sequence contains only
       ``.'' characters; otherwise, the sequence will be replaced
       with a single ``*'' character.

       A resource database never contains more than one entry for
       a given ResourceName.  If a resource file contains multi-
       ple lines with the same ResourceName, the last line in the
       file is used.

       Any white space characters before or after the name or
       colon in a ResourceSpec are ignored.  To allow a Value to
       begin with white space, the two-character sequence
       ``\<I>space</I>'' (backslash followed by space) is recognized and
       replaced by a space character, and the two-character
       sequence ``\<I>tab</I>'' (backslash followed by horizontal tab)
       is recognized and replaced by a horizontal tab character.
       To allow a Value to contain embedded newline characters,
       the two-character sequence ``\n'' is recognized and
       replaced by a newline character.  To allow a Value to be
       broken across multiple lines in a text file, the two-char-
       acter sequence ``\<I>newline</I>'' (backslash followed by new-
       line) is recognized and removed from the value.  To allow
       a Value to contain arbitrary character codes, the four-
       character sequence ``\<I>nnn</I>'', where each <I>n</I> is a digit char-
       acter in the range of ``0''-``7'', is recognized and
       replaced with a single byte that contains the octal value
       specified by the sequence.  Finally, the two-character
       sequence ``\\'' is recognized and replaced with a single
       backslash.
