       XVisibilityNotifyEvent - VisibilityNotify event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>VisibilityNotify</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* VisibiltyNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;
            int state;
       } XVisibilityEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the window whose visibility
       state changes.  The state member is set to the state of
       the window's visibility and can be <I>VisibilityUnobscured</I>,
       <I>VisibilityPartiallyObscured</I>, or <I>VisibilityFullyObscured</I>.
       The X server ignores all of a window's subwindows when
       determining the visibility state of the window and pro-
       cesses <I>VisibilityNotify</I> events according to the following:

       <B>o</B>    When the window changes state from partially
            obscured, fully obscured, or not viewable to viewable
            and completely unobscured, the X server generates the
            event with the state member of the <I>XVisibilityEvent</I>
            structure set to <I>VisibilityUnobscured</I>.

       <B>o</B>    When the window changes state from viewable and com-
            pletely unobscured or not viewable to viewable and
            partially obscured, the X server generates the event
            with the state member of the <I>XVisibilityEvent</I> struc-
            ture set to <I>VisibilityPartiallyObscured</I>.

       <B>o</B>    When the window changes state from viewable and com-
            pletely unobscured, viewable and partially obscured,

       entEvent(3X11), XResizeRequestEvent(3X11), XSelection-
       ClearEvent(3X11), XSelectionEvent(3X11), XSelectionRe-
       questEvent(3X11), XUnmapEvent(3X11),
