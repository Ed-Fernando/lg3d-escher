<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2><PRE>
       <I>angle1</I>    Specifies the start of the arc relative to the
                 three-o'clock position from the center, in units
                 of degrees * 64.

       <I>angle2</I>    Specifies the path and extent of the arc rela-
                 tive to the start of the arc, in units of
                 degrees * 64.

       <I>arcs</I>      Specifies an array of arcs.

       <I>d</I>         Specifies the drawable.

       <I>display</I>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>gc</I>        Specifies the GC.

       <I>narcs</I>     Specifies the number of arcs in the array.

       <I>width</I>
       <I>height</I>    Specify the width and height, which are the
                 major and minor axes of the arc.

       <I>x</I>
       <I>y</I>         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are rela-
                 tive to the origin of the drawable and specify
                 the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>XDrawArc</I> draws a single circular or elliptical arc, and
       <I>XDrawArcs</I> draws multiple circular or elliptical arcs.
       Each arc is specified by a rectangle and two angles.  The
       center of the circle or ellipse is the center of the rect-
       cated to discrete coordinates.  The path should be defined
       by the ideal mathematical path.  For a wide line with
       line-width lw, the bounding outlines for filling are given
       by the two infinitely thin paths consisting of all points
       whose perpendicular distance from the path of the cir-
       cle/ellipse is equal to lw/2 (which may be a fractional
       value).  The cap-style and join-style are applied the same
       as for a line corresponding to the tangent of the cir-
       cle/ellipse at the endpoint.

       For an arc specified as [<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>,<I>width</I>,<I>height</I>,<I>angle</I>1,<I>angle</I>2],
       the angles must be specified in the effectively skewed
       coordinate system of the ellipse (for a circle, the angles
       and coordinate systems are identical).  The relationship
       between these angles and angles expressed in the normal
       coordinate system of the screen (as measured with a pro-
       tractor) is as follows:

       skewed-angle=<I>atan</I>(tan(normal-angle)*<I>h</I<B>_</B><I>w</I<B><</B>I>e</I<B>_</B><I>i</I<B><</B>I>i</I<B>_</B><I>d</I<B><</B>I>g</I<B>_</B><I>t</I<B><</B>I>h</I<B>_</B><I>h</I<B><</B>I>t</I<B>_</B>)+<I>adjust</I>

       The skewed-angle and normal-angle are expressed in radians
       (rather than in degrees scaled by 64) in the range [0,2<B>n</B>]
       and where atan returns a value in the range [-<B>_</B>,<B>_</B>] and
       adjust is:

       0         for normal-angle in the range [0,<B>_</B>]
       <B>n</B>         for normal-angle in the range [<B>_</B>,<B>__</B>]
       2<B>n</B>        for normal-angle in the range [<B>__</B>,2<B>n</B>]

       For any given arc, <I>XDrawArc</I> and <I>XDrawArcs</I> do not draw a
       pixel more than once.  If two arcs join correctly and if
       the line-width is greater than zero and the arcs inter-
       sect, <I>XDrawArc</I> and <I>XDrawArcs</I> do not draw a pixel more than
       once.  Otherwise, the intersecting pixels of intersecting
       arcs are drawn multiple times.  Specifying an arc with one
       endpoint and a clockwise extent draws the same pixels as
       specifying the other endpoint and an equivalent counter-
       clockwise extent, except as it affects joins.

       If the last point in one arc coincides with the first
       point in the following arc, the two arcs will join cor-
       rectly.  If the first point in the first arc coincides
       with the last point in the last arc, the two arcs will
       join correctly.  By specifying one axis to be zero, a hor-
       izontal or vertical line can be drawn.  Angles are com-
       puted based solely on the coordinate system and ignore the
       aspect ratio.

       Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-
       mask, line-width, line-style, cap-style, join-style, fill-
       style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and
       clip-mask.  They also use these GC mode-dependent compo-
       } XArc;

       All x and y members are signed integers.  The width and
       height members are 16-bit unsigned integers.  You should
       be careful not to generate coordinates and sizes out of
       the 16-bit ranges, because the protocol only has 16-bit
       fields for these values.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       <I>BadDrawable</I>
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a
                 defined Window or Pixmap.

       <I>BadGC</I>     A value for a GContext argument does not name a
                 defined GContext.

       <I>BadMatch</I>  An <I>InputOnly</I> window is used as a Drawable.

       <I>BadMatch</I>  Some argument or pair of arguments has the cor-
                 rect type and range but fails to match in some
                 other way required by the request.
