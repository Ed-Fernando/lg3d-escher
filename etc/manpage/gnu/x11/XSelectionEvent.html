       XSelectionEvent - SelectionNotify event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>SelectionNotify</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* SelectionNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window requestor;
            Atom selection;
            Atom target;
            Atom property;           /* atom or None */
            Time time;
       } XSelectionEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The requestor member is set to the window associated with
       the requestor of the selection.  The selection member is
       set to the atom that indicates the selection.  For exam-
       ple, PRIMARY is used for the primary selection.  The tar-
       get member is set to the atom that indicates the converted
       type.  For example, PIXMAP is used for a pixmap.  The
       property member is set to the atom that indicates which
       property the result was stored on.  If the conversion
       failed, the property member is set to <I>None</I>.  The time mem-
       ber is set to the time the conversion took place and can
       be a timestamp or <I>CurrentTime</I>.
