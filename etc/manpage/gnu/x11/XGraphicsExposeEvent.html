       XGraphicsExposeEvent, XNoExposeEvent - GraphicsExpose and
       NoExpose event structures


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structures for <I>GraphicsExpose</I> and <I>NoExpose</I> events con-
       tain:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* GraphicsExpose */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Drawable drawable;
            int x, y;
            int width, height;
            int count;               /* if nonzero, at least this many more */
            int major_code;          /* core is CopyArea or CopyPlane */
            int minor_code;          /* not defined in the core */
       } XGraphicsExposeEvent;

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* NoExpose */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Drawable drawable;
            int major_code;          /* core is CopyArea or CopyPlane */
            int minor_code;          /* not defined in the core */
       } XNoExposeEvent;

       When you receive these events, their structure members are
       set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       Both structures have these common members: drawable,
       major_code, and minor_code.  The drawable member is set to
       the drawable of the destination region on which the graph-
       ics request was to be performed.  The major_code member is
       set to the graphics request initiated by the client and
       can be either <I>X</I><B>_</B><I>CopyArea</I> or <I>X</I><B>_</B><I>CopyPlane</I>.  If it is
       (extent) of the rectangle.  The count member is set to the
       number of <I>GraphicsExpose</I> events to follow.  If count is
       zero, no more <I>GraphicsExpose</I> events follow for this win-
       dow.  However, if count is nonzero, at least that number
       of <I>GraphicsExpose</I> events (and possibly more) are to follow
       for this window.
