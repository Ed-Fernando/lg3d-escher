       XSelectionRequestEvent - SelectionRequest event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>SelectionRequest</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* SelectionRequest */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window owner;
            Window requestor;
            Atom selection;
            Atom target;
            Atom property;
            Time time;
       } XSelectionRequestEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The owner member is set to the window that was specified
       by the current owner in its <I>XSetSelectionOwner</I> call.  The
       requestor member is set to the window requesting the
       selection.  The selection member is set to the atom that
       names the selection.  For example, PRIMARY is used to
       indicate the primary selection.  The target member is set
       to the atom that indicates the type the selection is
       desired in.  The property member can be a property name or
       <I>None</I>.  The time member is set to the timestamp or <I>Current-</I>
       <I>Time</I> value from the <I>ConvertSelection</I> request.
