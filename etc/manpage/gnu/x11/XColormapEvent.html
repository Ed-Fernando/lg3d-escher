       XColormapEvent - ColormapNotify event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>ColormapNotify</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* ColormapNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;
            Colormap colormap;       /* colormap or None */
            Bool new;
            int state;               /* ColormapInstalled, ColormapUninstalled */
       } XColormapEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the window whose associated
       colormap is changed, installed, or uninstalled.  For a
       colormap that is changed, installed, or uninstalled, the
       colormap member is set to the colormap associated with the
       window.  For a colormap that is changed by a call to
       <I>XFreeColormap</I>, the colormap member is set to <I>None</I>.  The
       new member is set to indicate whether the colormap for the
       specified window was changed or installed or uninstalled
       and can be <I>True</I> or <I>False</I>.  If it is <I>True</I>, the colormap was
       changed.  If it is <I>False</I>, the colormap was installed or
       uninstalled.  The state member is always set to indicate
       whether the colormap is installed or uninstalled and can
       be <I>ColormapInstalled</I> or <I>ColormapUninstalled</I>.
