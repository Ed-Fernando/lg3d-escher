<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structures for <I>KeyPress</I>, <I>KeyRelease</I>, <I>ButtonPress</I>,
       <I>ButtonRelease</I>, and <I>MotionNotify</I> events contain:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* ButtonPress or ButtonRelease */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;           /* ``event'' window it is reported relative to */
            Window root;             /* root window that the event occurred on */
            Window subwindow;        /* child window */
            Time time;               /* milliseconds */
            int x, y;                /* pointer x, y coordinates in event window */
            int x_root, y_root;      /* coordinates relative to root */
            unsigned int state;      /* key or button mask */
            unsigned int button;     /* detail */
            Bool same_screen;        /* same screen flag */
       } XButtonEvent;
       typedef XButtonEvent XButtonPressedEvent;
       typedef XButtonEvent XButtonReleasedEvent;

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* KeyPress or KeyRelease */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;           /* ``event'' window it is reported relative to */
            Window root;             /* root window that the event occurred on */
            Window subwindow;        /* child window */
            Time time;               /* milliseconds */
            int x, y;                /* pointer x, y coordinates in event window */
            int x_root, y_root;      /* coordinates relative to root */
            unsigned int state;      /* key or button mask */
            unsigned int keycode;    /* detail */
            Bool same_screen;        /* same screen flag */
       } XKeyEvent;
       typedef XKeyEvent XKeyPressedEvent;
       typedef XKeyEvent XKeyReleasedEvent;

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* MotionNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;           /* ``event'' window reported relative to */
            Window root;             /* root window that the event occurred on */
            Window subwindow;        /* child window */

       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       These structures have the following common members: win-
       dow, root, subwindow, time, x, y, x_root, y_root, state,
       and same_screen.  The window member is set to the window
       on which the event was generated and is referred to as the
       event window.  As long as the conditions previously dis-
       cussed are met, this is the window used by the X server to
       report the event.  The root member is set to the source
       window's root window.  The x_root and y_root members are
       set to the pointer's coordinates relative to the root win-
       dow's origin at the time of the event.

       The same_screen member is set to indicate whether the
       event window is on the same screen as the root window and
       can be either <I>True</I> or <I>False</I>.  If <I>True</I>, the event and root
       windows are on the same screen.  If <I>False</I>, the event and
       root windows are not on the same screen.

       If the source window is an inferior of the event window,
       the subwindow member of the structure is set to the child
       of the event window that is the source window or the child
       of the event window that is an ancestor of the source win-
       dow.  Otherwise, the X server sets the subwindow member to
       <I>None</I>.  The time member is set to the time when the event
       was generated and is expressed in milliseconds.

       If the event window is on the same screen as the root win-
       dow, the x and y members are set to the coordinates rela-
       tive to the event window's origin.  Otherwise, these mem-
       bers are set to zero.

       The state member is set to indicate the logical state of
       the pointer buttons and modifier keys just prior to the
       event, which is the bitwise inclusive OR of one or more of
       the button or modifier key masks: <I>Button1Mask</I>,
       <I>Button2Mask</I>, <I>Button3Mask</I>, <I>Button4Mask</I>, <I>Button5Mask</I>,
       <I>ShiftMask</I>, <I>LockMask</I>, <I>ControlMask</I>, <I>Mod1Mask</I>, <I>Mod2Mask</I>,
       <I>Mod3Mask</I>, <I>Mod4Mask</I>, and <I>Mod5Mask</I>.

       Each of these structures also has a member that indicates
       the detail.  For the <I>XKeyPressedEvent</I> and <I>XKeyReleasedE-</I>
       <I>vent</I> structures, this member is called a keycode.  It is
       ormapEvent(3X11), XConfigureEvent(3X11), XConfigur-
       eRequestEvent(3X11), XCrossingEvent(3X11), XDestroyWindow-
       Event(3X11), XErrorEvent(3X11), XExposeEvent(3X11), XFo-
       cusChangeEvent(3X11), XGraphicsExposeEvent(3X11), XGravi-
       tyEvent(3X11), XKeymapEvent(3X11), XMapEvent(3X11),
       XMapRequestEvent(3X11), XPropertyEvent(3X11), XRepar-
       entEvent(3X11), XResizeRequestEvent(3X11), XSelection-
       ClearEvent(3X11), XSelectionEvent(3X11), XSelectionRe-
       questEvent(3X11), XUnmapEvent(3X11), XVisibili-
       tyEvent(3X11)
