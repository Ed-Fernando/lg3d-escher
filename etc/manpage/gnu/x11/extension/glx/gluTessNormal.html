       <I>tess</I>    Specifies  the  tessellation  object (created with
               <B>gluNewTess</B>).

       <I>valueX</I>  Specifies the first component of the normal.

       <I>valueY</I>  Specifies the second component of the normal.

       <I>valueZ</I>  Specifies the third component of the normal.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>gluTessNormal</B> describes a normal for a  polygon  that  the
       program  is  defining.   All  input data will be projected
       onto a plane perpendicular to one of the three  coordinate
       axes  before tessellation and all output triangles will be
       oriented CCW with respect to the  normal  (CW  orientation
       can be obtained by reversing the sign of the supplied nor-
       mal). For example, if you know that all  polygons  lie  in
       the  x-y  plane,  call  <B>gluTessNormal</B>(tess, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
       before rendering any polygons.

       If the supplied normal is (0.0,  0.0,  0.0)  (the  initial
       value), the normal is determined as follows. The direction
       of the normal, up to its sign, is found by fitting a plane
       to  the  vertices,  without regard to how the vertices are
       connected. It is expected that the input data lies approx-
       imately  in the plane; otherwise, projection perpendicular
       to one of the  three  coordinate  axes  may  substantially
       change  the  geometry. The sign of the normal is chosen so
       that the sum of the signed areas of all input contours  is
       nonnegative (where a CCW contour has positive area).

       The  supplied  normal  persists  until  it  is  changed by
       another call to <B>gluTessNormal</B>.
