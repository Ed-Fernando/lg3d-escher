<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glDrawPixels</B>  reads  pixel  data from memory and writes it
       into the frame buffer
       relative to the current raster position, provided that the
       raster position is valid.  Use
       <B>glRasterPos</B>  to set the current raster position; use <B>glGet</B>
       with argument <B>GL_CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION_VALID</B>  to  deter-
       mine  if the specified raster position is valid, and <B>glGet</B>
       with  argument  <B>GL_CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION</B>  to  query  the
       raster position.

       Several  parameters  define  the encoding of pixel data in
       memory and control the processing of the pixel data before
       it  is  placed  in the frame buffer.  These parameters are
       set with  four  commands:  <B>glPixelStore</B>,  <B>glPixelTransfer</B>,
       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4</B>,      <B>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1</B>,
       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8</B>, <B>GL_UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2</B>,  each
       unsigned value is interpreted as containing all the compo-
       nents for  a  single  pixel,  with  the  color  components
       arranged  according  to  _param3.   When _param4 is one of
       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV</B>,   <B>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV</B>,
       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV</B>,
       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV</B>,
       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV</B>,
       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV</B>,  each  unsigned  value  is
       interpreted  as containing all color components, specified
       by _param3, for  a  single  pixel  in  a  reversed  order.
       Indices are always treated individually.  Color components
       are treated as groups of one, two, three, or four  values,
       again based on _param3. Both individual indices and groups
       of components are referred to as pixels.   If  _param4  is
       <B>GL_BITMAP</B>,  the  data  must be unsigned bytes, and _param3
       must be either <B>GL_COLOR_INDEX</B> or  <B>GL_STENCIL_INDEX</B>.   Each
       unsigned  byte  is treated as eight 1-bit pixels, with bit
       ordering   determined    by    <B>GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST</B>    (see
       <B>glPixelStore</B>).

       _param1x_param2  pixels  are read from memory, starting at
       location _param5.  By default, these pixels are taken from
       adjacent  memory  locations, except that after all _param1
       pixels are read, the read pointer is advanced to the  next
       four-byte boundary.  The four-byte row alignment is speci-
       fied by <B>glPixelStore</B>  with  argument  <B>GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT</B>,
       and  it  can  be  set  to  one, two, four, or eight bytes.
       Other  pixel  store  parameters  specify  different   read
       pointer  advancements, both before the first pixel is read
       and  after  all  _param1  pixels  are   read.    See   the
       <B>glPixelStore</B>  reference page for details on these options.

       The _param1x_param2 pixels that are read from  memory  are
       each  operated  on in the same way, based on the values of
       several  parameters  specified  by   <B>glPixelTransfer</B>   and
       <B>glPixelMap</B>.   The  details of these operations, as well as
       the target buffer into which the  pixels  are  drawn,  are
       specific  to  the  of the pixels, as specified by _param3.
       _param3 can assume one of 13 symbolic values:

       <B>GL_COLOR_INDEX</B>
                 Each pixel is a single value, a color index.  It
                 is  converted  to fixed-point , with an unspeci-
                 fied number of bits to the right of  the  binary
                 point,  regardless  of  the  memory  data  type.
                 Floating-point values  convert  to  true  fixed-
                 point  values.  Signed and unsigned integer data
                 is converted with all fraction bits  set  to  0.
                 Bitmap data convert to either 0 or 1.

                 table  <B>GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I</B>.   Whether the lookup
                 replacement of the index is  done  or  not,  the
                 integer  part  of  the  index is then ANDed with
                 2<I>b</I>-1, where <I>b</I> is the number of bits in  a  color
                 index buffer.

                 The  GL  then  converts the resulting indices or
                 RGBA colors to fragments by attaching  the  cur-
                 rent  raster  position  <I>z</I> coordinate and texture
                 coordinates to each pixel, then assigning <I>x</I>  and
                 <I>y</I>  window  coordinates  to the <I>n</I>th fragment such
                 that

                               <I>xn</I>=<I>xr</I>+<I>n</I>mod_<I>eqnparam</I>1

                               <I>yn</I>=<I>yr</I>+|<I>n</I>/_<I>eqnparam</I>1|


                 where (<I>xr</I>,<I>yr</I>) is the  current  raster  position.
                 These pixel fragments are then treated just like
                 the fragments generated by  rasterizing  points,
                 lines,  or  polygons.  Texture mapping, fog, and
                 all the fragment operations are  applied  before
                 the fragments are written to the frame buffer.

       <B>GL_STENCIL_INDEX</B>
                 Each  pixel  is a single value, a stencil index.
                 It is converted to fixed-point , with an unspec-
                 ified  number of bits to the right of the binary
                 point,  regardless  of  the  memory  data  type.
                 Floating-point  values  convert  to  true fixed-
                 point values.  Signed and unsigned integer  data
                 is  converted  with  all fraction bits set to 0.
                 Bitmap data convert to either 0 or 1.

                 Each fixed-point index is then shifted  left  by
                 <B>GL_INDEX_SHIFT</B>     bits,     and     added    to
                 <B>GL_INDEX_OFFSET</B>.  If <B>GL_INDEX_SHIFT</B> is negative,
                 the shift is to the right.  In either case, zero
                 bits fill otherwise unspecified bit locations in
                 the  result.   If  <B>GL_MAP_STENCIL</B>  is  true, the
                 index is replaced with the value that it  refer-
                 ences   in   lookup  table  <B>GL_PIXEL_MAP_S_TO_S</B>.
                 Whether the lookup replacement of the  index  is
                 done  or  not,  the integer part of the index is
                 then ANDed with 2<I>b</I>-1, where <I>b</I> is the  number  of
                 bits in the stencil buffer.  The resulting sten-
                 cil indices are  then  written  to  the  stencil
                 buffer  such  that  the  <I>n</I>th index is written to
                 location

                             <I>xn</I>=<I>xr</I>+<I>n</I>mod_<I>eqnparam</I>1

               such  that the most positive representable integer
              value maps to 1.0, and  the  most  negative  repre-
              sentable value maps to -1.0.  Unsigned integer data
              is mapped similarly: the largest integer value maps
              to 1.0, and 0 maps to 0.0.  The resulting floating-
              point   depth   value   is   then   multiplied   by
              <B>GL_DEPTH_SCALE</B>  and  added  to  <B>GL_DEPTH_BIAS</B>.  The
              result is clamped to the range [0,1].

              The GL then converts the resulting depth components
              to  fragments by attaching the current raster posi-
              tion color or color index and  texture  coordinates
              to  each pixel, then assigning <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> window coor-
              dinates to the <I>n</I>th fragment such that

                             <I>xn</I>=<I>xr</I>+<I>n</I>mod_<I>eqnparam</I>1

                             <I>yn</I>=<I>yr</I>+|<I>n</I>/_<I>eqnparam</I>1|


              where  (<I>xr</I>,<I>yr</I>)  is  the  current  raster  position.
              These  pixel  fragments  are then treated just like
              the  fragments  generated  by  rasterizing  points,
              lines,  or polygons.  Texture mapping, fog, and all
              the fragment  operations  are  applied  before  the
              fragments are written to the frame buffer.

       <B>GL_RGBA</B>

       <B>GL_BGRA</B>
              Each  pixel is a four-component group: for <B>GL_RGBA</B>,
              the red component is first, followed by green, fol-
              lowed  by  blue, followed by alpha; for <B>GL_BGRA</B> the
              order is blue, green, red and then  alpha.   Float-
              ing-point  values  are  converted  directly  to  an
              internal floating-point
               with unspecified precision.  Signed integer values
              are mapped linearly to the internal floating-point
               such  that the most positive representable integer
              value maps to 1.0, and  the  most  negative  repre-
              sentable  value  maps to -1.0. (Note that this map-
              ping  does  not  convert  0  precisely   to   0.0.)
              Unsigned  integer  data  is  mapped  similarly: the
              largest integer value maps to 1.0, and  0  maps  to
              0.0.  The resulting floating-point color values are
              then  multiplied  by  <B>GL_c_SCALE</B>   and   added   to
              <B>GL_c_BIAS</B>,  where  <I>c</I> is RED, GREEN, BLUE, and ALPHA
              for the respective color components.   The  results
              are clamped to the range [0,1].

              If  <B>GL_MAP_COLOR</B>  is  true, each color component is
              scaled   by    the    size    of    lookup    table

              where  (<I>xr</I>,<I>yr</I>)  is  the  current  raster  position.
              These pixel fragments are then  treated  just  like
              the  fragments  generated  by  rasterizing  points,
              lines, or polygons.  Texture mapping, fog, and  all
              the  fragment  operations  are  applied  before the
              fragments are written to the frame buffer.

       <B>GL_RED</B> Each pixel is a single red component.  This  compo-
              nent  is  converted  to the internal floating-point
              in the same way the red component of an RGBA  pixel
              is.  It  is  then  converted  to an RGBA pixel with
              green and blue set to 0, and alpha set to 1.  After
              this  conversion, the pixel is treated as if it had
              been read as an RGBA pixel.

       <B>GL_GREEN</B>
              Each pixel is a single green component.  This  com-
              ponent  is converted to the internal floating-point
              in the same way the  green  component  of  an  RGBA
              pixel  is.   It  is then converted to an RGBA pixel
              with red and blue set to 0, and  alpha  set  to  1.
              After  this  conversion, the pixel is treated as if
              it had been read as an RGBA pixel.

       <B>GL_BLUE</B>
              Each pixel is a single blue component.  This compo-
              nent  is  converted  to the internal floating-point
              in the same way the blue component of an RGBA pixel
              is.  It is then converted to an RGBA pixel with red
              and green set to 0, and alpha set to 1.  After this
              conversion,  the pixel is treated as if it had been
              read as an RGBA pixel.

       <B>GL_ALPHA</B>
              Each pixel is a single alpha component.  This  com-
              ponent  is converted to the internal floating-point
              in the same way the  alpha  component  of  an  RGBA
              pixel  is.   It  is then converted to an RGBA pixel
              with red, green, and blue set  to  0.   After  this
              conversion,  the pixel is treated as if it had been
              read as an RGBA pixel.

       <B>GL_RGB</B>

       <B>GL_BGR</B> Each pixel is a three-component group:  red  first,
              followed  by  green,  followed by blue; for <B>GL_BGR</B>,
              the first component is blue, followed by green  and
              then  red.   Each  component  is  converted  to the
              internal floating-point  in the same way  the  red,
              green,  and  blue  components of an RGBA pixel are.
              The color triple is converted to an RGBA pixel with
              Each pixel  is  a  two-component  group:  luminance
              first,  followed  by alpha.  The two components are
              converted to the internal  floating-point   in  the
              same  way  the  red  component of an RGBA pixel is.
              They are then converted to an RGBA pixel with  red,
              green,  and  blue  set  to  the converted luminance
              value, and alpha set to the converted alpha  value.
              After  this  conversion, the pixel is treated as if
              it had been read as an RGBA pixel.

       The rasterization described so far assumes pixel zoom fac-
       tors of 1.  If
       <B>glPixelZoom</B> is used to change the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> pixel zoom  fac-
       tors,  pixels  are  converted to fragments as follows.  If
       (<I>xr</I>, <I>yr</I>) is the current raster position, and a given pixel
       is  in  the <I>n</I>th column and <I>m</I>th row of the pixel rectangle,
       then fragments are generated for pixels whose centers  are
       in the rectangle with corners at

                            (<I>xr</I>+<I>zoomxn</I>, <I>yr</I>+<I>zoomym</I>)

                        (<I>xr</I>+<I>zoomx</I>(<I>n</I>+1), <I>yr</I>+<I>zoomy</I>(<I>m</I>+1))

       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV</B>  are only valid for _param4
       if the GL version is 1.2 or greater.

       <B>GL_INVALID_VALUE</B> is generated if either _param1 or _param2
       is negative.

       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B>  is generated if _param3 or _param4 is not
       one of the accepted values.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if  _param3  is  <B>GL_RED</B>,

       <B>GL_BGRA</B>, <B>GL_LUMINANCE</B>, or <B>GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA</B>, and  the  GL
       is in color index mode.

       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B>  is  generated if _param4 is <B>GL_BITMAP</B> and
       _param3 is not either <B>GL_COLOR_INDEX</B> or  <B>GL_STENCIL_INDEX</B>.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>    is   generated   if   _param3   is
       <B>GL_STENCIL_INDEX</B> and there is no stencil buffer.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if <B>glDrawPixels</B> is  exe-
       cuted between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the correspond-
       ing execution of <B>glEnd</B>.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>  is  generated  if  _param3  is   one
