<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>tess</I>  Specifies  the  tessellation  object  (created  with
             <B>gluNewTess</B>).

       <I>type</I>  Specifies the type of  the  contour  being  defined.
             Valid   values   are   <B>GLU_EXTERIOR</B>,   <B>GLU_INTERIOR</B>,
             <B>GLU_UNKNOWN</B>, <B>GLU_CCW</B>, and <B>GLU_CW</B>.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>gluNextContour</B> is used in describing polygons with  multi-
       ple  contours.  After the first contour has been described
       through a series of <B>gluTessVertex</B> calls, a  <B>gluNextContour</B>
       call  indicates  that the previous contour is complete and
       that the next contour is about to begin.   Another  series
       of  <B>gluTessVertex</B>  calls  is then used to describe the new
       contour. This process can be repeated until  all  contours
       have been described.

       <I>type</I> defines what type of contour follows.  The legal con-
       tour types are as follows:

       <B>GLU_EXTERIOR</B>      An exterior contour defines an  exterior
                         boundary of the polygon.

       <B>GLU_INTERIOR</B>      An  interior contour defines an interior
                         boundary  of  the  polygon  (such  as  a
                         hole).

       <B>GLU_UNKNOWN</B>       An  unknown  contour  is analyzed by the
                         library to determine if it  is  interior
                         or exterior.

       <B>GLU_CCW</B>,

       <B>GLU_CW</B>            The  first  <B>GLU_CCW</B>  or  <B>GLU_CW</B>  contour
                         defined is considered  to  be  exterior.
                         All  other contours are considered to be
                         exterior if they  are  oriented  in  the
                         same  direction  (clockwise  or counter-
                         clockwise) as  the  first  contour,  and
                         interior if they are not.

       If one contour is of type <B>GLU_CCW</B> or <B>GLU_CW</B>, then all con-
       tours must be of the same type (if they are not, then  all

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2><PRE>
       A quadrilateral with  a  triangular  hole  in  it  can  be
       described as follows:

       gluBeginPolygon(tobj);
          gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
          gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
          gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
          gluTessVertex(tobj,   v4,   v4);   gluNextContour(tobj,
       GLU_INTERIOR);
          gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
          gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
          gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7); gluEndPolygon(tobj);
