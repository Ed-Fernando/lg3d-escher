<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Specifies the mapping of the near clipping  plane
                to window coordinates.  The initial value is 0.

       _param2  Specifies  the  mapping of the far clipping plane
                to window coordinates.  The initial value is 1.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       After clipping and division by <I>w</I>, depth coordinates  range
       from  -1  to 1, corresponding to the near and far clipping
       planes.  <B>glDepthRange</B> specifies a linear  mapping  of  the
       normalized depth coordinates in this range to window depth
       coordinates.  Regardless of the actual depth buffer imple-
       mentation,  window  coordinate depth values are treated as
       though they range from 0  through  1  (like  color  compo-
       nents).   Thus,  the  values  accepted by <B>glDepthRange</B> are
       both clamped to this range before they are accepted.

       The setting of (0,1) maps the near plane to 0 and the  far
       plane  to 1.  With this mapping, the depth buffer range is
       fully utilized.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       It is not necessary that _param1  be  less  than  _param2.
       Reverse  mappings  such  as _<I>eqnparam</I>1=1, and _<I>eqnparam</I>2=0
       are acceptable.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if <B>glDepthRange</B> is  exe-
       cuted between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the correspond-
       ing execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
