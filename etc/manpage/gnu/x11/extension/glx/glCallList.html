<H2>C SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Specifies the integer name of the display list to
                be executed.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glCallList</B> causes the named display list to  be  executed.
       The  commands  saved  in  the display list are executed in
       order, just as if they were called without using a display
       list.   If _param1 has not been defined as a display list,
       <B>glCallList</B> is ignored.

       <B>glCallList</B> can appear inside a display list.  To avoid the
       possibility  of  infinite recursion resulting from display
       lists calling one another, a limit is placed on the  nest-
       ing  level of display lists during display-list execution.
       This limit is at least 64, and it depends on the implemen-
       tation.

       GL  state  is  not  saved  and  restored  across a call to
       <B>glCallList</B>.  Thus, changes made to  GL  state  during  the
       execution  of a display list remain after execution of the
       display list is completed.  Use <B>glPushAttrib</B>, <B>glPopAttrib</B>,
       <B>glPushMatrix</B>,  and <B>glPopMatrix</B> to preserve GL state across
       <B>glCallList</B> calls.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Display lists can be executed between a  call  to  <B>glBegin</B>
       and  the  corresponding call to <B>glEnd</B>, as long as the dis-
       play list includes only commands that are allowed in  this
       interval.
