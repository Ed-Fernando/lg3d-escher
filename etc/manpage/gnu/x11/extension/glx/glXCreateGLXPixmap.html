       <B>glXCreateGLXPixmap</B>  -  create  an off-screen GLX rendering
       area

       GLXPixmap <B>glXCreateGLXPixmap</B>( Display <I>*dpy</I>,
                                     XVisualInfo <I>*vis</I>,

<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>dpy</I>     Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>vis</I>     Specifies the visual that defines the structure of
               the  rendering  area.   It  is  a  pointer  to  an
               <B>XVisualInfo</B>  structure,  not  a  visual  ID  or  a
               pointer to a <B>Visual</B>.

       <I>pixmap</I>  Specifies  the  X  pixmap that will be used as the
               front left color buffer of the off-screen  render-
               ing area.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glXCreateGLXPixmap</B>  creates  an  off-screen rendering area
       and returns its XID.  Any GLX rendering context  that  was
       created  with  respect  to  <I>vis</I> can be used to render into
       this off-screen area.  Use <B>glXMakeCurrent</B> to associate the
       rendering area with a GLX rendering context.

       The  X  pixmap  identified  by <I>pixmap</I> is used as the front
       left buffer of the resulting  off-screen  rendering  area.
       All  other  buffers  specified  by  <I>vis</I>,  including  color
       buffers other than the  front  left  buffer,  are  created
       without  externally  visible names.  GLX pixmaps with dou-
       ble-buffering are supported.  However,  <B>glXSwapBuffers</B>  is
       ignored by these pixmaps.

       Some  implementations  may  not  support  GLX pixmaps with
       direct rendering contexts.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>XVisualInfo</B> is defined in <I>Xutil.h.</I>  It is a structure that
       includes <I>visual</I>, <I>visualID</I>, <I>screen</I>, and <I>depth</I> elements.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>BadMatch</B>  is  generated  if  the  depth of <I>pixmap</I> does not
       match the depth value reported by core X11 for <I>vis</I>, or  if
       <I>pixmap</I>  was not created with respect to the same screen as
       <I>vis</I>.

       <B>BadValue</B> is generated if <I>vis</I> is not  a  valid  XVisualInfo
       pointer  (for  example, if a particular GLX implementation
