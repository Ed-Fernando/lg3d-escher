       _param1  Specifies  a symbolic constant, one of <B>GL_VENDOR</B>,
                <B>GL_RENDERER</B>, <B>GL_VERSION</B>, or <B>GL_EXTENSIONS</B>.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glGetString</B> returns a pointer to a static string  describ-
       ing some aspect of the current GL connection.  _param1 can
       be one of the following:

       <B>GL_VENDOR</B>           Returns the  company  responsible  for
                           this  GL  implementation.   This  name
                           does  not  change  from   release   to
                           release.

       <B>GL_RENDERER</B>         Returns  the  name  of  the  renderer.
                           This name is typically specific  to  a
                           particular configuration of a hardware
                           platform.  It  does  not  change  from
                           release to release.

       <B>GL_VERSION</B>          Returns a version or release number.

       <B>GL_EXTENSIONS</B>       Returns a space-separated list of sup-
                           ported extensions to GL.

       Because the GL does not include queries  for  the  perfor-
       mance  characteristics of an implementation, some applica-
       tions are written to recognize known platforms and  modify
       their  GL usage based on known performance characteristics
       of these platforms.   Strings  <B>GL_VENDOR</B>  and  <B>GL_RENDERER</B>
       together  uniquely  specify a platform. They do not change
       from release to release and should be  used  by  platform-
       recognition algorithms.

       Some  applications  want  to make use of features that are
       not part of the standard GL. These features may be  imple-
       mented   as   extensions   to   the   standard   GL.   The
       <B>GL_EXTENSIONS</B> string is a  space-separated  list  of  sup-
       ported  GL  extensions.   (Extension names never contain a
       space character.)

       The <B>GL_VERSION</B> string begins with a version  number.   The
       version number uses one of these forms:

       <I>major</I><B>_</B><I>number.minor</I><B>_</B><I>number</I>
       <I>major</I><B>_</B><I>number.minor</I><B>_</B><I>number.release</I><B>_</B><I>number</I>

       Vendor-specific information may follow the version number.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B> is generated if _param1 is not an accepted
       value.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if <B>glGetString</B>  is  exe-
       cuted between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the correspond-
       ing execution of <B>glEnd</B>.



                                                                1
