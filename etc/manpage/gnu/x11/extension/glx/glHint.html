<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Certain aspects of GL behavior, when  there  is  room  for
       interpretation,  can  be controlled with hints.  A hint is
       specified with two arguments.  _param1 is a symbolic  con-
       stant  indicating  the  behavior  to  be  controlled,  and
       _param2  is  another  symbolic  constant  indicating   the
       desired  behavior.  The  initial value for each _param1 is
       <B>GL_DONT_CARE</B>.  _param2 can be one of the following:

       <B>GL_FASTEST</B>          The most efficient  option  should  be
                           chosen.

       <B>GL_NICEST</B>           The  most correct, or highest quality,
                           option should be chosen.

       <B>GL_DONT_CARE</B>        No preference.

       Though the implementation aspects that can be  hinted  are
       well  defined,  the interpretation of the hints depends on
       the implementation.  The hint aspects that can  be  speci-
       fied  with _param1, along with suggested semantics, are as
       follows:

       <B>GL_FOG_HINT</B>         Indicates the accuracy of fog calcula-
                           tion.  If per-pixel fog calculation is
                           not efficiently supported  by  the  GL
                           implementation,  hinting  <B>GL_DONT_CARE</B>
                           or <B>GL_FASTEST</B> can result in per-vertex
                           calculation of fog effects.

       <B>GL_LINE_SMOOTH_HINT</B> Indicates   the  sampling  quality  of
                           antialiased lines.  If a larger filter
                           function is applied, hinting <B>GL_NICEST</B>
                           can result  in  more  pixel  fragments
                           being generated during rasterization,

                           <B>GL_NICEST</B>  can  result  in  more pixel
                           fragments being generated during  ras-
                           terization,

       <B>GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH_HINT</B>
                           Indicates   the  sampling  quality  of
                           antialiased     polygons.      Hinting
                           <B>GL_NICEST</B>  can  result  in  more pixel
                           fragments being generated during  ras-
                           terization,  if  a larger filter func-
                           tion is applied.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       The interpretation of hints depends on the implementation.
       Some implementations ignore <B>glHint</B> settings.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B>  is generated if either _param1 or _param2
       is not an accepted value.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if  <B>glHint</B>  is  executed
       between  the  execution  of  <B>glBegin</B> and the corresponding
       execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
