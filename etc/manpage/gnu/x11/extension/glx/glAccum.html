       _param1  Specifies   the  accumulation  buffer  operation.
                Symbolic  constants  <B>GL_ACCUM</B>,  <B>GL_LOAD</B>,  <B>GL_ADD</B>,
                <B>GL_MULT</B>, and <B>GL_RETURN</B> are accepted.

       _param2  Specifies  a  floating-point  value  used  in the
                accumulation buffer  operation.   _param1  deter-
                mines how _param2 is used.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The accumulation buffer is an extended-range color buffer.
       Images are not rendered into it.  Rather, images  rendered
       into one of the color buffers are added to the contents of
       the accumulation buffer after rendering.  Effects such  as
       antialiasing  (of  points,  lines,  and  polygons), motion
       blur, and depth of field can be  created  by  accumulating
       images generated with different transformation matrices.

       Each  pixel  in  the  accumulation buffer consists of red,
       green, blue, and alpha values.  The  number  of  bits  per
       component in the accumulation buffer depends on the imple-
       mentation.  You  can  examine  this  number   by   calling
       <B>glGetIntegerv</B>      four      times,     with     arguments
       <B>GL_ACCUM_RED_BITS</B>,                    <B>GL_ACCUM_GREEN_BITS</B>,
       <B>GL_ACCUM_BLUE_BITS</B>,  and  <B>GL_ACCUM_ALPHA_BITS</B>.  Regardless
       of the number of bits per component, the range  of  values
       stored  by  each  component  is [-1, 1].  The accumulation
       buffer pixels are mapped one-to-one with frame buffer pix-
       els.

       <B>glAccum</B>  operates  on  the accumulation buffer.  The first
       argument, _param1, is a symbolic constant that selects  an
       accumulation   buffer  operation.   The  second  argument,
       _param2, is a floating-point value  to  be  used  in  that
       operation.    Five  operations  are  specified:  <B>GL_ACCUM</B>,
       <B>GL_LOAD</B>, <B>GL_ADD</B>, <B>GL_MULT</B>, and <B>GL_RETURN</B>.

       All accumulation buffer operations are limited to the area
       of  the current scissor box and applied identically to the
       red, green, blue, and alpha components of each pixel.   If
       a  <B>glAccum</B>  operation results in a value outside the range
       [-1, 1], the contents of an accumulation buffer pixel com-
       ponent are undefined.

       The operations are as follows:

       <B>GL_ACCUM</B>      Obtains  R,  G,  B,  and  A  values from the
                     buffer currently selected for  reading  (see
                     rently  selected buffer are divided by 2<I>n</I>-1,
                     multiplied by _param2, and  then  stored  in
                     the  corresponding accumulation buffer cell,
                     overwriting the current value.

       <B>GL_ADD</B>        Adds _param2 to each R, G, B, and A  in  the
                     accumulation buffer.

       <B>GL_MULT</B>       Multiplies  each R, G, B, and A in the accu-
                     mulation buffer by _param2 and  returns  the
                     scaled  component to its corresponding accu-
                     mulation buffer location.

       <B>GL_RETURN</B>     Transfers accumulation buffer values to  the
                     color  buffer  or buffers currently selected
                     for writing.  Each R, G, B, and A  component
                     is multiplied by _param2, then multiplied by
                     2<I>n</I>-1, clamped to  the  range  [0,2<I>n</I>-1],  and
                     stored  in  the corresponding display buffer
                     cell.  The only fragment operations that are
                     applied  to  this  transfer are pixel owner-
                     ship,   scissor,   dithering,   and    color
                     writemasks.

       To  clear  the accumulation buffer, call <B>glClearAccum</B> with
       R, G, B, and A values to set it to, then call <B>glClear</B> with
       the accumulation buffer enabled.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Only  pixels within the current scissor box are updated by
       a <B>glAccum</B> operation.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B> is generated if _param1 is not an accepted
       value.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if there is no accumula-
       tion buffer.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if <B>glAccum</B>  is  executed
       between  the  execution  of  <B>glBegin</B> and the corresponding
       execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
