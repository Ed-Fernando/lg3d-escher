</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>x</I>, <I>y</I> Specify  the  center  of  a  picking region in window
            coordinates.

       <I>delX</I>, <I>delY</I>
            Specify the width and height,  respectively,  of  the
            picking region in window coordinates.

       <I>viewport</I>
            Specifies  the current viewport (as from a <B>glGetInte-</B>
            <B>gerv</B> call).

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>gluPickMatrix</B> creates a projection matrix that can be used
       to  restrict  drawing  to  a small region of the viewport.
       This is typically useful to  determine  what  objects  are
       being   drawn  near  the  cursor.   Use  <B>gluPickMatrix</B>  to
       restrict drawing to a  small  region  around  the  cursor.
       Then,  enter selection mode (with <B>glRenderMode</B>) and reren-
       der the scene.  All primitives that would have been  drawn
       near the cursor are identified and stored in the selection
       buffer.

       The matrix created by <B>gluPickMatrix</B> is multiplied  by  the
       current  matrix just as if <B>glMultMatrix</B> is called with the
       generated matrix.  To effectively use the  generated  pick
       matrix  for  picking, first call <B>glLoadIdentity</B> to load an
       identity matrix onto the perspective matrix  stack.   Then
       call  <B>gluPickMatrix</B>,  and finally, call a command (such as
       <B>gluPerspective</B>) to multiply the perspective matrix by  the
       pick matrix.

       When using <B>gluPickMatrix</B> to pick NURBS, be careful to turn
       off   the   NURBS   property   <B>GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX</B>.    If
       <B>GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX</B>  is  not  turned  off, then any NURBS
       surface rendered is subdivided differently with  the  pick
       matrix  than  the  way  it was subdivided without the pick
       matrix.




       a portion of the viewport can be selected as a pick region
       like this:

       glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);  glLoadIdentity(); gluPickMa-
       trix(x, y, width, height, viewport);  gluPerspective(...);
       glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); /* Draw the scene */
