       _param1  Specifies  the number of display lists to be exe-
                cuted.

       _param2  Specifies the type of values  in  _param3.   Sym-
                bolic    constants   <B>GL_BYTE</B>,   <B>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</B>,
                <B>GL_SHORT</B>,       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT</B>,        <B>GL_INT</B>,
                <B>GL_UNSIGNED_INT</B>,       <B>GL_FLOAT</B>,      <B>GL_2_BYTES</B>,
                <B>GL_3_BYTES</B>, and <B>GL_4_BYTES</B> are accepted.

       _param3  Specifies the address of an array of name offsets
                in  the  display  list.  The pointer type is void
                because the offsets can be bytes,  shorts,  ints,
                or floats, depending on the value of _param2.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glCallLists</B>  causes each display list in the list of names
       passed as _param3 to be executed.  As a result,  the  com-
       mands  saved  in  each display list are executed in order,
       just as if they were called without using a display  list.
       Names  of  display  lists  that  have not been defined are
       ignored.

       <B>glCallLists</B> provides an efficient means for executing more
       than  one display list.  _param2 allows lists with various
       name formats to be accepted.  The formats are as follows:

       <B>GL_BYTE</B>                  _param3 is treated as an array of
                                signed  bytes,  each in the range
                                -128 through 127.

       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</B>         _param3 is treated as an array of
                                unsigned bytes, each in the range
                                0 through 255.

       <B>GL_SHORT</B>                 _param3 is treated as an array of
                                signed two-byte integers, each in
                                the range -32768 through 32767.

       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT</B>        _param3 is treated as an array of
                                unsigned  two-byte integers, each
                                in the range 0 through 65535.

       <B>GL_INT</B>                   _param3 is treated as an array of
                                signed four-byte integers.

       <B>GL_UNSIGNED_INT</B>          _param3 is treated as an array of
                                unsigned four-byte integers.
                                unsigned bytes.  Each triplet  of
                                bytes specifies a single display-
                                list  name.   The  value  of  the
                                triplet   is  computed  as  65536
                                times the unsigned value  of  the
                                first  byte,  plus  256 times the
                                unsigned  value  of  the   second
                                byte,  plus the unsigned value of
                                the third byte.

       <B>GL_4_BYTES</B>               _param3 is treated as an array of
                                unsigned  bytes.  Each quadruplet
                                of bytes specifies a single  dis-
                                play-list name.  The value of the
                                quadruplet   is    computed    as
                                16777216 times the unsigned value
                                of the  first  byte,  plus  65536
                                times  the  unsigned value of the
                                second byte, plus 256  times  the
                                unsigned value of the third byte,
                                plus the unsigned  value  of  the
                                fourth byte.

       The  list  of  display-list  names is not null-terminated.
       Rather, _param1 specifies how many names are to  be  taken
       from _param3.

       An  additional level of indirection is made available with
       the <B>glListBase</B> command, which specifies an unsigned offset
       that  is  added  to  each  display-list  name specified in
       _param3 before that display list is executed.

       <B>glCallLists</B> can appear inside a display  list.   To  avoid
       the  possibility of infinite recursion resulting from dis-
       play lists calling one another, a limit is placed  on  the
       nesting  level of display lists during display-list execu-
       tion.  This limit must be at least 64, and it  depends  on
       the implementation.

       GL  state  is  not  saved  and  restored  across a call to
       <B>glCallLists</B>.  Thus, changes made to GL  state  during  the
       execution  of  the display lists remain after execution is
       completed.  Use <B>glPushAttrib</B>,  <B>glPopAttrib</B>,  <B>glPushMatrix</B>,
       and  <B>glPopMatrix</B>  to  preserve GL state across <B>glCallLists</B>
       calls.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Display lists can be executed between a  call  to  <B>glBegin</B>
       and  the  corresponding call to <B>glEnd</B>, as long as the dis-
       play list includes only commands that are allowed in  this
       interval.
