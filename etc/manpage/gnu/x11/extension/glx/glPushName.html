       _param1  Specifies  a  name  that  will be pushed onto the
                name stack.

<H2>C SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The name stack is used during selection mode to allow sets
       of  rendering commands to be uniquely identified.  It con-
       sists of an ordered set of unsigned integers and  is  ini-
       tially empty.

       <B>glPushName</B>  causes  <B>_param1(1)</B>  to be pushed onto the name
       stack.  <B>glPopName</B> pops one name off the top of the  stack.

       The  maximum name stack depth is implementation-dependent;
       call <B>GL_MAX_NAME_STACK_DEPTH</B> to find out the value  for  a
       particular  implementation.  It is an error to push a name
       onto a full stack, or to pop a name off  an  empty  stack.
       It  is  also an error to manipulate the name stack between
       the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the  corresponding  execution
       of  <B>glEnd</B>.   In  any of these cases, the error flag is set
       and no other change is made to GL state.

       The name stack is always empty while the  render  mode  is
       not <B>GL_SELECT</B>.  Calls to <B>glPushName</B> or <B>glPopName</B> while the
       render mode is not <B>GL_SELECT</B> are ignored.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_STACK_OVERFLOW</B> is generated  if  <B>glPushName</B>  is  called
       while the name stack is full.

       <B>GL_STACK_UNDERFLOW</B>  is  generated  if  <B>glPopName</B> is called
       while the name stack is empty.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>  is  generated   if   <B>glPushName</B>   or
       <B>glPopName</B>  is  executed  between a call to <B>glBegin</B> and the
       corresponding call to <B>glEnd</B>.
