<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1
              Specifies  a pointer to an array that contains red,
              green, blue, and (sometimes) alpha values.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The GL stores both a current single-valued color index and
       a  current  four-valued  RGBA  color.   <B>glColor</B> sets a new
       four-valued RGBA color.  <B>glColor</B> has two  major  variants:
       <B>glColor3</B> and <B>glColor4</B>.  <B>glColor3</B> variants specify new red,
       green, and blue values  explicitly  and  set  the  current
       alpha  value to 1.0 (full intensity) implicitly.  <B>glColor4</B>
       variants specify all four color components explicitly.

       <B>glColor3b</B>, <B>glColor4b</B>, <B>glColor3s</B>, <B>glColor4s</B>, <B>glColor3i</B>, and
       <B>glColor4i</B>  take  three or four signed byte, short, or long
       integers as arguments.  When <B>v</B> is appended  to  the  name,
       the  color commands can take a pointer to an array of such
       values.

       Current color values are stored in floating-point  ,  with
       unspecified mantissa and exponent sizes.  Unsigned integer
       color components, when specified, are linearly  mapped  to
       floating-point  values such that the largest representable
       value maps to 1.0 (full intensity),  and  0  maps  to  0.0
       (zero  intensity).   Signed integer color components, when
       specified, are linearly mapped  to  floating-point  values
       such  that  the  most positive representable value maps to
       1.0, and the most negative  representable  value  maps  to
       -1.0. (Note that this mapping does not convert 0 precisely
       to 0.0.)  Floating-point values are mapped directly.

       Neither  floating-point  nor  signed  integer  values  are
       clamped  to  the  range  [0,1] before the current color is
       updated.  However, color components are  clamped  to  this
       range before they are interpolated or written into a color
       buffer.



                                                                1
