       <B>glXMakeCurrent</B> - attach a GLX context to a window or a GLX
       pixmap



</PRE>
<H2>C SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       Bool <B>glXMakeCurrent</B>( Display <I>*dpy</I>,
                            GLXDrawable <I>drawable</I>,
                            GLXContext <I>ctx</I> )



</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>dpy</I>       Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>drawable</I>  Specifies a GLX drawable.  Must be either  an  X
                 window ID or a GLX pixmap ID.

       <I>ctx</I>       Specifies  a GLX rendering context that is to be
                 attached to <I>drawable</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glXMakeCurrent</B> does two things: It makes <I>ctx</I>  the  current
       GLX rendering context of the calling thread, replacing the
       previously current  context  if  there  was  one,  and  it
       attaches  <I>ctx</I>  to a GLX drawable, either a window or a GLX
       pixmap.  As a result of these two actions,  subsequent  GL
       rendering  calls  use  rendering context <I>ctx</I> to modify GLX
       drawable <I>drawable</I>  (for  reading  and  writing).   Because
       <B>glXMakeCurrent</B>  always replaces the current rendering con-
       text with <I>ctx</I>, there can be only one current  context  per
       thread.

       Pending  commands  to  the  previous  context, if any, are
       flushed before it is released.

       The first time <I>ctx</I> is made  current  to  any  thread,  its
       viewport  is set to the full size of <I>drawable</I>.  Subsequent
       calls by any thread to <B>glXMakeCurrent</B>  with  <I>ctx</I>  have  no
       effect on its viewport.

       To  release  the  current  context without assigning a new
       one, call <B>glXMakeCurrent</B> with <I>drawable</I> set  <B>None</B>  and  <I>ctx</I>
       set to <B>NULL</B>

       <B>glXMakeCurrent</B>  returns  <B>True</B>  if  it is successful, <B>False</B>
       otherwise.  If <B>False</B> is returned, the  previously  current
       rendering  context and drawable (if any) remain unchanged.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       A <I>process</I> is a single-execution  environment,  implemented
       in  a  single  address  space,  consisting  of one or more
       threads.


       <B>GLXBadDrawable</B> is generated if <I>drawable</I> is not a valid GLX
       drawable.

       <B>GLXBadContext</B> is generated if <I>ctx</I> is not a valid GLX  con-
       text.

       <B>GLXBadContextState</B>  is generated if <B>glXMakeCurrent</B> is exe-
       cuted between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the correspond-
       ing execution of <B>glEnd</B>.

       <B>GLXBadContextState</B> is also generated if the rendering con-
       text current to the calling thread has GL  renderer  state
       <B>GL_FEEDBACK</B> or <B>GL_SELECT</B>.

       <B>GLXBadCurrentWindow</B>  is  generated if there are pending GL
       commands for the previous context and the current drawable
       is a window that is no longer valid.

       <B>BadAlloc</B>  may be generated if the server has delayed allo-
       cation  of  ancillary  buffers  until  <B>glXMakeCurrent</B>   is
       called, only to find that it has insufficient resources to
       complete the allocation.
