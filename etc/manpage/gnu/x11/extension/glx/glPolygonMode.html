       _param1  Specifies  the  polygons that _param2 applies to.
                Must  be  <B>GL_FRONT</B>  for  front-facing   polygons,
                <B>GL_BACK</B>     for    back-facing    polygons,    or
                <B>GL_FRONT_AND_BACK</B>  for  front-  and   back-facing
                polygons.

       _param2  Specifies   how   polygons  will  be  rasterized.
                Accepted  values  are  <B>GL_POINT</B>,   <B>GL_LINE</B>,   and
                <B>GL_FILL</B>.   The  initial value is <B>GL_FILL</B> for both
                front- and back-facing polygons.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glPolygonMode</B> controls the interpretation of polygons  for
       rasterization.   _param1  describes which polygons _param2
       applies to: front-facing polygons (<B>GL_FRONT</B>),  back-facing
       polygons  (<B>GL_BACK</B>),  or  both  (<B>GL_FRONT_AND_BACK</B>).   The
       polygon mode affects only the final rasterization of poly-
       gons.  In particular, a polygon's vertices are lit and the
       polygon is clipped and possibly culled before these  modes
       are applied.

       Three modes are defined and can be specified in _param2:

       <B>GL_POINT</B>      Polygon  vertices  that  are  marked  as the
                     start  of  a  boundary  edge  are  drawn  as
                     points.     Point    attributes    such   as
                     <B>GL_POINT_SIZE</B>  and  <B>GL_POINT_SMOOTH</B>  control
                     the  rasterization  of  the points.  Polygon
                     rasterization    attributes    other    than
                     <B>GL_POLYGON_MODE</B> have no effect.

       <B>GL_LINE</B>       Boundary  edges  of the polygon are drawn as
                     line segments.  They  are  treated  as  con-
                     nected line segments for line stippling; the
                     line stipple counter  and  pattern  are  not
                     reset  between segments (see <B>glLineStipple</B>).
                     Line attributes such  as  <B>GL_LINE_WIDTH</B>  and
                     <B>GL_LINE_SMOOTH</B>  control the rasterization of
                     the lines.  Polygon rasterization attributes
                     other than <B>GL_POLYGON_MODE</B> have no effect.

       <B>GL_FILL</B>       The  interior  of  the  polygon  is  filled.
                     Polygon       attributes       such       as
                     <B>GL_POLYGON_STIPPLE</B>   and   <B>GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH</B>
                     control the rasterization of the polygon.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if <B>glPolygonMode</B> is exe-
       cuted between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the correspond-
       ing execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
