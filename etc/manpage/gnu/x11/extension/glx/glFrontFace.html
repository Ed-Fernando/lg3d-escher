       _param1  Specifies  the  orientation of front-facing poly-
                gons.  <B>GL_CW</B> and <B>GL_CCW</B> are accepted.   The  ini-
                tial value is <B>GL_CCW</B>.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       In  a  scene  composed entirely of opaque closed surfaces,
       back-facing polygons are never visible.  Eliminating these
       invisible  polygons has the obvious benefit of speeding up
       the rendering of the image.  To enable and disable  elimi-
       nation   of   back-facing   polygons,  call  <B>glEnable</B>  and
       <B>glDisable</B> with argument <B>GL_CULL_FACE</B>.

       The projection of a polygon to window coordinates is  said
       to have clockwise winding if an imaginary object following
       the path from its first vertex, its second vertex, and  so
       on, to its last vertex, and finally back to its first ver-
       tex, moves in a clockwise direction about the interior  of
       the polygon.  The polygon's winding is said to be counter-
       clockwise if the imaginary object following the same  path
       moves  in  a counterclockwise direction about the interior
       of the polygon.  <B>glFrontFace</B>  specifies  whether  polygons
       with  clockwise winding in window coordinates, or counter-
       clockwise winding in window coordinates, are taken  to  be
       front-facing.   Passing <B>GL_CCW</B> to _param1 selects counter-
       clockwise polygons as front-facing; <B>GL_CW</B>  selects  clock-
       wise  polygons as front-facing.  By default, counterclock-
       wise polygons are taken to be front-facing.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B> is generated if _param1 is not an accepted
       value.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>  is  generated if <B>glFrontFace</B> is exe-
       cuted between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the correspond-
       ing execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
