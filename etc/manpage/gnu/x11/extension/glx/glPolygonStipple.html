<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Specifies  a  pointer  to a 32x32 stipple pattern
                that will be unpacked from memory in the same way
                that <B>glDrawPixels</B> unpacks pixels.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Polygon    stippling,    like    line    stippling    (see
       <B>glLineStipple</B>), masks out certain  fragments  produced  by
       rasterization,  creating a pattern.  Stippling is indepen-
       dent of polygon antialiasing.

       _param1 is a pointer to a 32x32 stipple  pattern  that  is
       stored  in  memory  just like the pixel data supplied to a
       <B>glDrawPixels</B> call with <I>height</I> and <I>width</I> both equal to  32,
       a  pixel  of  <B>GL_COLOR_INDEX</B>,  and data type of <B>GL_BITMAP</B>.
       That is, the stipple pattern is  represented  as  a  32x32
       array  of  1-bit  color  indices packed in unsigned bytes.
       <B>glPixelStore</B>  parameters  like  <B>GL_UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES</B>   and
       <B>GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST</B> affect the assembling of the bits into
       a stipple pattern.  Pixel transfer operations (shift, off-
       set, pixel map) are not applied to the stipple image, how-
       ever.

       To enable and disable polygon stippling, call <B>glEnable</B> and
       <B>glDisable</B>  with argument <B>GL_POLYGON_STIPPLE</B>. Polygon stip-
       pling is initially disabled. If it's enabled, a rasterized
       polygon fragment with window coordinates <I>xw</I> and <I>yw</I> is sent
       to the next stage of the GL if and only if the (<I>xw</I>mod32)th
       bit  in  the  (<I>yw</I>mod32)th  row of the stipple pattern is 1
       (one).  When polygon stippling is disabled, it  is  as  if
       the stipple pattern consists of all 1's.

<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>  is  generated if <B>glPolygonStipple</B> is
       executed between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and  the  corre-
       sponding execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
