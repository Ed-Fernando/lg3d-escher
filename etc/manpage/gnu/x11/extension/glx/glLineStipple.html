<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Specifies  a  multiplier for each bit in the line
                stipple pattern.  If _param1 is 3,  for  example,
                each  bit  in  the  pattern  is  used three times
                before the next  bit  in  the  pattern  is  used.
                _param1  is  clamped  to  the  range [1, 256] and
                defaults to 1.

       _param2  Specifies a  16-bit  integer  whose  bit  pattern
                determines  which  fragments  of  a  line will be
                drawn when the line is rasterized.  Bit  zero  is
                used first; the default pattern is all 1's.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Line  stippling  masks  out  certain fragments produced by
       rasterization; those fragments will  not  be  drawn.   The
       masking  is achieved by using three parameters: the 16-bit
       line stipple pattern _param2, the  repeat  count  _param1,
       and an integer stipple counter <I>s</I>.

       Counter  <I>s</I>  is  reset to 0 whenever <B>glBegin</B> is called, and
       before each  line  segment  of  a  <B>glBegin</B>(<B>GL_LINES</B>)/<B>glEnd</B>
       sequence is generated.  It is incremented after each frag-
       ment of a unit width aliased line segment is generated, or
       after each <I>i</I> fragments of an <I>i</I> width line segment are gen-
       erated.  The <I>i</I>  fragments  associated  with  count  <I>s</I>  are
       masked out if

                    _param2 bit (<I>s</I>/_<I>eqnparam</I>1)mod16

       is  0,  otherwise  these  fragments  are sent to the frame
       buffer.  Bit zero of _param2 is the least significant bit.

       Antialiased  lines  are  treated  as a sequence of 1x<I>width</I>
       rectangles for purposes of stippling.  Whether rectagle  <I>s</I>
       is   rasterized  or  not  depends  on  the  fragment  rule
       described for aliased lines,  counting  rectangles  rather
       than groups of fragments.

       To  enable  and  disable line stippling, call <B>glEnable</B> and
       <B>glDisable</B> with argument  <B>GL_LINE_STIPPLE</B>.   When  enabled,
       the  line  stipple  pattern is applied as described above.
       When disabled, it is as if the pattern were all 1's.  Ini-
       tially, line stippling is disabled.
