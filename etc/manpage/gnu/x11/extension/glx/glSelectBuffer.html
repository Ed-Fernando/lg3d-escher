<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Specifies the size of _param2.

       _param2  Returns the selection data.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glSelectBuffer</B>  has two arguments: _param2 is a pointer to
       an array of unsigned integers, and _param1  indicates  the
       size  of  the array.  _param2 returns values from the name
       stack (see <B>glInitNames</B>, <B>glLoadName</B>, <B>glPushName</B>)  when  the
       rendering    mode   is   <B>GL_SELECT</B>   (see   <B>glRenderMode</B>).
       <B>glSelectBuffer</B> must be issued  before  selection  mode  is
       enabled,  and  it  must  not be issued while the rendering
       mode is <B>GL_SELECT</B>.

       A programmer can use selection to determine  which  primi-
       tives  are drawn into some region of a window.  The region
       is defined by the current modelview and perspective matri-
       ces.

       In  selection  mode,  no pixel fragments are produced from
       rasterization.  Instead, if a primitive or a raster  posi-
       tion intersects the clipping volume defined by the viewing
       frustum and the user-defined clipping planes, this  primi-
       tive  causes  a  selection  hit.   (With  polygons, no hit
       occurs if the polygon is culled.)  When a change  is  made
       to  the  name stack, or when <B>glRenderMode</B> is called, a hit
       record is copied to _param2  if  any  hits  have  occurred
       since   the   last   such  event  (name  stack  change  or
       <B>glRenderMode</B> call).  The hit record consists of the number
       of  names in the name stack at the time of the event, fol-
       lowed by the minimum and maximum depth values of all  ver-
       tices  that  hit since the previous event, followed by the
       name stack contents, bottom name first.

       Depth values (which are in the range [0,1]) are multiplied
       by 2^32 - 1, before being placed in the hit record.

       An  internal  index  into  _param2  is reset to 0 whenever
       selection mode is entered.  Each  time  a  hit  record  is
       copied  into _param2, the index is incremented to point to
       the cell just past the end of the block of  names  -  that
       is,  to  the  next  available  cell.  If the hit record is
       larger than the number of remaining locations in  _param2,
       as  much  data as can fit is copied, and the overflow flag
       is set.  If the name stack is empty when a hit  record  is
       copied,  that record consists of 0 followed by the minimum
       and maximum depth values.
       <B>glBegin</B>/<B>glEnd</B> primitives  and  calls  to  <B>glRasterPos</B>  can
       result in hits.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_VALUE</B> is generated if _param1 is negative.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>  is  generated  if  <B>glSelectBuffer</B> is
       called  while  the  render  mode  is  <B>GL_SELECT</B>,   or   if
       <B>glRenderMode</B>  is  called  with  argument  <B>GL_SELECT</B> before
       <B>glSelectBuffer</B> is called at least once.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is  generated  if  <B>glSelectBuffer</B>  is
       executed  between  the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the corre-
       sponding execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
