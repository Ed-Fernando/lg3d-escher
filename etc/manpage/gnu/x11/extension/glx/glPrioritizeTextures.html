<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Specifies  the  number  of textures to be priori-
                tized.

       _param2  Specifies an array containing the  names  of  the
                textures to be prioritized.

       _param3  Specifies an array containing the texture priori-
                ties.  A priority given in an element of  _param3
                applies to the texture named by the corresponding
                element of _param2.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glPrioritizeTextures</B> assigns the _param1  texture  priori-
       ties  given  in  _param3  to the _param1 textures named in
       _param2.

       The GL establishes a ``working set'' of textures that  are
       resident  in  texture memory.  These textures may be bound
       to a texture target much more  efficiently  than  textures
       that  are not resident.  By specifying a priority for each
       texture, <B>glPrioritizeTextures</B> allows applications to guide
       the GL implementation in determining which textures should
       be resident.

       The priorities given in _param3 are clamped to  the  range
       [0,1]  before  they  are assigned.  0 indicates the lowest
       priority; textures with priority 0 are least likely to  be
       resident.  1 indicates the highest priority; textures with
       priority 1 are most likely to be resident.  However,  tex-
       tures  are  not  guaranteed  to be resident until they are
       used.

       <B>glPrioritizeTextures</B> silently ignores attempts to  priori-
       tize  texture  0, or any texture name that does not corre-
       spond to an existing texture.

       <B>glPrioritizeTextures</B> does not require that any of the tex-
       tures  named  by  _param2  be  bound  to a texture target.
       <B>glTexParameter</B> may also be used to set a texture's  prior-
       ity,  but only if the texture is currently bound.  This is
       the only way to set the priority of a default texture.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>glPrioritizeTextures</B> is available only if the  GL  version
       is 1.1 or greater.
