       <B>glXCopyContext</B>  - copy state from one rendering context to
       another



</PRE>
<H2>C SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       void <B>glXCopyContext</B>( Display <I>*dpy</I>,
                            GLXContext <I>src</I>,
                            GLXContext <I>dst</I>,
                            unsigned long <I>mask</I> )



</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>dpy</I>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>src</I>   Specifies the source context.

       <I>dst</I>   Specifies the destination context.

       <I>mask</I>  Specifies which portions of  <I>src</I>  state  are  to  be
             copied to <I>dst</I>.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glXCopyContext</B>  copies  selected groups of state variables
       from <I>src</I> to <I>dst</I>.  <I>mask</I> indicates  which  groups  of  state
       variables  are to be copied.  <I>mask</I> contains the bitwise OR
       of the same symbolic names that are passed to the GL  com-
       mand   <B>glPushAttrib</B>.    The   single   symbolic   constant
       <B>GL_ALL_ATTRIB_BITS</B> can be used to copy the maximum  possi-
       ble portion of rendering state.

       The  copy  can  be done only if the renderers named by <I>src</I>
       and <I>dst</I> share an address space.   Two  rendering  contexts
       share  an  address  space  if both are nondirect using the
       same server, or if both are direct and owned by  a  single
       process.  Note that in the nondirect case it is not neces-
       sary for the calling threads to share  an  address  space,
       only  for  their  related  rendering  contexts to share an
       address space.

       Not all values for GL state can be copied.   For  example,
       pixel pack and unpack state, render mode state, and select
       and feedback state are not copied.  The state that can  be
       copied  is exactly the state that is manipulated by the GL
       command
       <B>glPushAttrib</B>.

       An implicit <B>glFlush</B> is done by <B>glXCopyContext</B>  if  <I>src</I>  is
       the current context for the calling thread.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       A  <I>process</I>  is a single execution environment, implemented
       in a single address  space,  consisting  of  one  or  more
       (including the calling thread) at the time  <B>glXCopyContext</B>
       is called.

       <B>GLXBadCurrentWindow</B>  is  generated  if  <I>src</I> is the current
       context and the current drawable is a window  that  is  no
       longer valid.

       <B>GLXBadContext</B>  is  generated if either <I>src</I> or <I>dst</I> is not a
       valid GLX context.
