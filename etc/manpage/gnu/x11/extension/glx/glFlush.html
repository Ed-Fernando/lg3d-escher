<H2>C SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Different  GL  implementations  buffer commands in several
       different locations, including  network  buffers  and  the
       graphics accelerator itself.  <B>glFlush</B> empties all of these
       buffers, causing all issued commands  to  be  executed  as
       quickly  as  they  are  accepted  by  the actual rendering
       engine.  Though this execution may not be completed in any
       particular time period, it does complete in finite time.

       Because  any  GL program might be executed over a network,
       or on an accelerator that buffers commands,  all  programs
       should  call  <B>glFlush</B> whenever they count on having all of
       their previously issued commands completed.  For  example,
       call <B>glFlush</B> before waiting for user input that depends on
       the generated image.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>glFlush</B> can return at any time.  It does  not  wait  until
       the execution of all previously issued GL commands is com-
       plete.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if <B>glFlush</B>  is  executed
       between  the  execution  of  <B>glBegin</B> and the corresponding
       execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
