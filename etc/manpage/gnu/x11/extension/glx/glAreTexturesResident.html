<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Specifies the number of textures to be queried.

       _param2  Specifies  an  array  containing the names of the
                textures to be queried.

       _param3  Specifies an array in which the texture residence
                status  is  returned.   The residence status of a
                texture  named  by  an  element  of  _param2   is
                returned in the corresponding element of _param3.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       GL establishes a ``working set'' of textures that are res-
       ident in texture memory.  These textures can be bound to a
       texture target much more efficiently  than  textures  that
       are not resident.

       <B>glAreTexturesResident</B> queries the texture residence status
       of the _param1 textures named by the elements of  _param2.
       If     all    the    named    textures    are    resident,
       <B>glAreTexturesResident</B> returns <B>GL_TRUE</B>, and the contents of
       _param3  are  undisturbed.   If not all the named textures
       are resident, <B>glAreTexturesResident</B> returns <B>GL_FALSE</B>,  and
       detailed  status  is  returned  in the _param1 elements of
       _param3.  If an element of _param3 is  <B>GL_TRUE</B>,  then  the
       texture  named  by the corresponding element of _param2 is
       resident.

       The residence status of a single bound texture may also be
       queried by calling <B>glGetTexParameter</B> with the <I>target</I> argu-
       ment set to the target to which the texture is bound,  and
       the  <I>pname</I>  argument  set to <B>GL_TEXTURE_RESIDENT</B>.  This is
       the only way that the residence status of a  default  tex-
       ture can be queried.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>glAreTexturesResident</B>  is available only if the GL version
       is 1.1 or greater.

       <B>glAreTexturesResident</B> returns the residency status of  the
       textures  at the time of invocation. It does not guarantee
       that the textures will remain resident at any other  time.

       If  textures reside in virtual memory (there is no texture
       memory), they are considered always resident.

       Some implementations may not  load  a  texture  until  the
       first use of that texture.
       <B>glGetTexParameter</B> with parameter name  <B>GL_TEXTURE_RESIDENT</B>
       retrieves  the  residence status of a currently bound tex-
       ture.
