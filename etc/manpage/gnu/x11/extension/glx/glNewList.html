       _param1  Specifies the display-list name.

       _param2  Specifies  the  compilation  mode,  which  can be
                <B>GL_COMPILE</B> or <B>GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE</B>.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Display lists are groups of GL  commands  that  have  been
       stored  for  subsequent execution.  Display lists are cre-
       ated with <B>glNewList</B>.  All subsequent commands  are  placed
       in  the display list, in the order issued, until <B>glEndList</B>
       is called.

       <B>glNewList</B>  has  two  arguments.    The   first   argument,
       <B>_param1(1)</B>,  is a positive integer that becomes the unique
       name for the display  list.   Names  can  be  created  and
       reserved  with  <B>glGenLists</B>  and tested for uniqueness with
       <B>glIsList</B>.  The second argument, <B>_param2(1)</B>, is a  symbolic
       constant that can assume one of two values:

       <B>GL_COMPILE</B>                    Commands   are  merely  com-
                                     piled.

       <B>GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE</B>        Commands  are  executed   as
                                     they  are  compiled into the
                                     display list.

       Certain commands are not compiled into  the  display  list
       but  are  executed immediately, regardless of the display-
       list  mode.   These  commands  are  <B>glAreTexturesResident</B>,
       <B>glColorPointer</B>,      <B>glDeleteLists</B>,      <B>glDeleteTextures</B>,
       <B>glDisableClientState</B>,                   <B>glEdgeFlagPointer</B>,
       <B>glEnableClientState</B>,  <B>glFeedbackBuffer</B>, <B>glFinish</B>, <B>glFlush</B>,
       <B>glGenLists</B>,         <B>glGenTextures</B>,         <B>glIndexPointer</B>,
       <B>glInterleavedArrays</B>,  <B>glIsEnabled</B>,  <B>glIsList</B>, <B>glIsTexture</B>,
       <B>glNormalPointer</B>,     <B>glPopClientAttrib</B>,      <B>glPixelStore</B>,
       <B>glPushClientAttrib</B>,       <B>glReadPixels</B>,      <B>glRenderMode</B>,
       <B>glSelectBuffer</B>,  <B>glTexCoordPointer</B>,  <B>glVertexPointer</B>,  and
       all of the <B>glGet</B> commands.

       Similarly,  <B>glTexImage1D</B>,  <B>glTexImage2D</B>,  and <B>glTexImage3D</B>
       are executed immediately and not compiled into the display
       list  when  their  first  argument is <B>GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D</B>,
       <B>GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D</B>, or <B>GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_3D</B>, respectively.

       When    the   <B>GL_ARB_imaging</B>   extension   is   supported,
       <B>glHistogram</B> executes  immediately  when  its  argument  is


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>glCallList</B> and <B>glCallLists</B> can  be  entered  into  display
       lists.   Commands in the display list or lists executed by
       <B>glCallList</B> or <B>glCallLists</B> are not included in the  display
       list  being  created,  even  if  the list creation mode is
       <B>GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE</B>.

       A display list is just a group of commands and  arguments,
       so  errors generated by commands in a display list must be
       generated when the list is executed. If the list  is  cre-
       ated  in  <B>GL_COMPILE</B>  mode, errors are not generated until
       the list is executed.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_VALUE</B> is generated if <B>_param1(1)</B> is 0.

       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B> is  generated  if  <B>_param2(1)</B>  is  not  an
       accepted value.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>  is  generated if <B>glEndList</B> is called
       without a preceding <B>glNewList</B>, or if <B>glNewList</B>  is  called
       while a display list is being defined.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>   is   generated   if   <B>glNewList</B>  or
       <B>glEndList</B> is executed between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and
       the corresponding execution of <B>glEnd</B>.

       <B>GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY</B>  is  generated  if  there is insufficient
       memory to compile the display list. If the GL  version  is
       1.1 or greater, no change is made to the previous contents
       of the display list, if any, and no other change  is  made
       to  the GL state. (It is as if no attempt had been made to
       create the new display list.)
