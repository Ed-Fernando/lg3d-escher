<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Specifies  the  target  to  which  the texture is
                bound.     Must    be    either    <B>GL_TEXTURE_1D</B>,
                <B>GL_TEXTURE_2D</B>, or <B>GL_TEXTURE_3D</B>.

       _param2  Specifies the name of a texture.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glBindTexture</B>  lets  you  create  or  use a named texture.
       Calling <B>glBindTexture</B> with
       _param1 set to <B>GL_TEXTURE_1D</B>, <B>GL_TEXTURE_2D</B>, <B>GL_TEXTURE_3D</B>
       and  _param2  set  to the name of the newtexture binds the
       texture name to the target.  When a texture is bound to  a
       target,  the previous binding for that target is automati-
       cally broken.

       Texture names are unsigned integers.  The  value  zero  is
       reserved to represent the default texture for each texture
       target.  Texture names and the corresponding texture  con-
       tents  are  local  to  the  shared display-list space (see
       <B>glXCreateContext</B>) of the current GL rendering context; two
       rendering  contexts  share texture names only if they also
       share display lists.

       You may use <B>glGenTextures</B> to generate a set of new texture
       names.

       When a texture is first bound, it assumes the dimensional-
       ity of its target:  A texture first bound to <B>GL_TEXTURE_1D</B>
       becomes  one-dimensional,  and  a  texture  first bound to
       <B>GL_TEXTURE_2D</B> becomes two-dimensional, and a texture first
       bound  to  <B>GL_TEXTURE_3D</B>  becomes a three-dimensional tex-
       ture. The state of a one-dimensional  texture  immediately
       after  it is first bound is equivalent to the state of the
       default <B>GL_TEXTURE_1D</B> at GL initialization, and  similarly
       for two-, and three-dimensional textures.

       While  a  texture is bound, GL operations on the target to
       which it is bound affect the bound texture, and queries of
       the  target  to  which  it  is bound return state from the
       bound texture. If texture mapping of the dimensionality of
       the  target  to  which  a  texture is bound is active, the
       bound texture is used.  In  effect,  the  texture  targets
       become  aliases  for the textures currently bound to them,
       and the texture name zero refers to the  default  textures
       that were bound to them at initialization.

       A  texture  binding  created  with  <B>glBindTexture</B>  remains


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>glBindTexture</B> is available only if the GL version  is  1.1
       or greater.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B>  is generated if _param1 is not one of the
       allowable values.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if _param2 has a  dimen-
       sionality that doesn't match that of _param1.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if <B>glBindTexture</B> is exe-
       cuted between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the correspond-
       ing execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
