                on the implementation, but at least eight  lights
                are  supported.   They are identified by symbolic

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glLight</B> sets the values of individual light source parame-
       ters.   _param1  names the light and is a symbolic name of
       the form <B>GL_LIGHT</B><I>i</I>, where 0 &lt;= i &lt; <B>GL_MAX_LIGHTS</B>.  _param2
       specifies  one  of  ten  light source parameters, again by
       symbolic name.  _param3 is either  a  single  value  or  a
       pointer to an array that contains the new values.

       To  enable and disable lighting calculation, call <B>glEnable</B>
       and <B>glDisable</B> with argument <B>GL_LIGHTING</B>. Lighting is  ini-
       tially  disabled.   When it is enabled, light sources that
       are enabled contribute to the lighting calculation.  Light
                           floating-point   values  are  clamped.
                           The initial ambient light intensity is
                           (0, 0, 0, 1).

       <B>GL_DIFFUSE</B>          _param3   contains   four  integer  or
                           floating-point values that specify the
                           diffuse  RGBA  intensity of the light.
                           Integer  values  are  mapped  linearly
                           such  that  the  most  positive repre-
                           sentable value maps to  1.0,  and  the
                           most negative representable value maps
                           to -1.0.   Floating-point  values  are
                           mapped  directly.  Neither integer nor
                           floating-point  values  are   clamped.
                           The initial value for <B>GL_LIGHT0</B> is (1,
                           1, 1, 1); for other lights,  the  ini-
                           tial value is (0, 0, 0, 0).

       <B>GL_SPECULAR</B>         _param3   contains   four  integer  or
                           floating-point values that specify the
                           specular  RGBA intensity of the light.
                           Integer  values  are  mapped  linearly
                           such  that  the  most  positive repre-
                           sentable value maps to  1.0,  and  the
                           most negative representable value maps
                           to -1.0.   Floating-point  values  are
                           mapped  directly.  Neither integer nor
                           floating-point  values  are   clamped.
                           The initial value for <B>GL_LIGHT0</B> is (1,
                           1, 1, 1); for other lights,  the  ini-
                           tial value is (0, 0, 0, 0).

       <B>GL_POSITION</B>         _param3   contains   four  integer  or
                           floating-point values that specify the
                           position  of  the light in homogeneous
                           object coordinates.  Both integer  and
                           floating-point   values   are   mapped
                           directly.  Neither integer nor  float-
                           ing-point values are clamped.

                           The  position  is  transformed  by the
                           modelview  matrix  when   <B>glLight</B>   is
                           called  (just  as if it were a point),
                           and it is stored in  eye  coordinates.
                           If  the <I>w</I> component of the position is
                           0, the light is treated  as  a  direc-
                           tional  source.   Diffuse and specular
                           lighting calculations take the light's
                           direction,  but  not  its actual posi-
                           tion, into account, and attenuation is
                           disabled.    Otherwise,   diffuse  and
                           specular  lighting  calculations   are
                           ing-point values are clamped.

                           The  spot  direction is transformed by
                           the inverse of  the  modelview  matrix
                           when  <B>glLight</B> is called (just as if it
                           were a normal), and it  is  stored  in
                           eye  coordinates.   It  is significant
                           only when <B>GL_SPOT_CUTOFF</B> is  not  180,
                           which  it  is  initially.  The initial
                           direction is (0, 0, -1).

       <B>GL_SPOT_EXPONENT</B>    _param3 is a single integer or  float-
                           ing-point  value  that  specifies  the
                           intensity distribution of  the  light.
                           Integer  and floating-point values are
                           mapped directly.  Only values  in  the
                           range [0,128] are accepted.

                           Effective  light  intensity is attenu-
                           ated  by  the  cosine  of  the   angle
                           between the direction of the light and
                           the direction from the  light  to  the
                           vertex  being  lighted,  raised to the
                           power of  the  spot  exponent.   Thus,
                           higher spot exponents result in a more
                           focused light  source,  regardless  of
                           the    spot    cutoff    angle    (see
                           <B>GL_SPOT_CUTOFF</B>, next paragraph).   The
                           initial  spot exponent is 0, resulting
                           in uniform light distribution.

       <B>GL_SPOT_CUTOFF</B>      _param3 is a single integer or  float-
                           ing-point  value  that  specifies  the
                           maximum  spread  angle  of   a   light
                           source.   Integer  and  floating-point
                           values are mapped directly.  Only val-
                           ues  in  the range [0,90] and the spe-
                           cial value 180 are accepted.   If  the
                           angle  between  the  direction  of the
                           light and the direction from the light
                           to the vertex being lighted is greater
                           than the spot cutoff angle, the  light
                           is  completely masked.  Otherwise, its
                           intensity is controlled  by  the  spot
                           exponent  and the attenuation factors.
                           The  initial  spot  cutoff   is   180,
                           resulting  in  uniform light distribu-
                           tion.

                           uation factors are (1, 0, 0),  result-
                           ing in no attenuation.

<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B>  is generated if either _param1 or _param2
       is not an accepted value.

       <B>GL_INVALID_VALUE</B> is generated if a spot exponent value  is
       specified  outside the range [0,128], or if spot cutoff is
       specified outside the range [0,90] (except for the special
       value  180), or if a negative attenuation factor is speci-
       fied.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if <B>glLight</B>  is  executed
       between  the  execution  of  <B>glBegin</B> and the corresponding
       execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
