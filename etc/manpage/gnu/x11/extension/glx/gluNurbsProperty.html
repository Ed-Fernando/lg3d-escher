</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>gluNurbsProperty</B> is used to control properties stored in a
       NURBS object. These properties affect the way that a NURBS
       curve is rendered. The accepted values for <I>property</I> are as
       follows:

       <B>GLU_NURBS_MODE</B> <I>value</I>   should   be   set   to   be  either
                      <B>GLU_NURBS_RENDERER</B>                       or
                      <B>GLU_NURBS_TESSELLATOR</B>.    When    set    to
                      <B>GLU_NURBS_RENDERER</B>, NURBS objects are  tes-
                      sellated into OpenGL primitives and sent to
                      the pipeline for  rendering.  When  set  to
                      <B>GLU_NURBS_TESSELLATOR</B>,  NURBS  objects  are
                      tessellated into OpenGL primitives but  the
                      vertices,  normals, colors, and/or textures
                      are  retrieved  back  through  a   callback
                      interface   (see   <B>gluNurbsCallback</B>).  This
                      allows the user to  cache  the  tessellated
                      results  for  further processing.  The ini-
                      tial value is <B>GLU_NURBS_RENDERER</B>.

       <B>GLU_SAMPLING_METHOD</B>
                      Specifies how a  NURBS  surface  should  be
                      tessellated.    <I>value</I>   may   be   one   of
                      <B>GLU_PATH_LENGTH</B>,      <B>GLU_PARAMETRIC_ERROR</B>,
                      surfaces they approximate.

                      <B>GLU_DOMAIN_DISTANCE</B>  allows  users to spec-
                      ify, in parametric  coordinates,  how  many
                      sample  points per unit length are taken in
                      <I>u</I>, <I>v</I> direction.

                      <B>GLU_OBJECT_PATH_LENGTH</B>    is   similar   to
                      <B>GLU_PATH_LENGTH</B>  except  that  it  is  view
                      independent, that is, the surface  is  ren-
                      dered so that the maximum length, in object
                      space, of edges of the  tessellation  poly-
                      gons  is  no greater than what is specified
                      by <B>GLU_SAMPLING_TOLERANCE</B>.

                      <B>GLU_OBJECT_PARAMETRIC_ERROR</B> is  similar  to
                      <B>GLU_PARAMETRIC_ERROR</B> except that it is view
                      independent, that is, the surface  is  ren-
                      dered  in  such a way that the value speci-
                      fied by <B>GLU_PARAMETRIC_TOLERANCE</B>  describes
                      the  maximum  distance,  in  object  space,
                      between the tessellation polygons  and  the
                      surfaces they approximate.

                      The initial value of <B>GLU_SAMPLING_METHOD</B> is
                      <B>GLU_PATH_LENGTH</B>.

       <B>GLU_SAMPLING_TOLERANCE</B>
                      Specifies the maximum length, in pixels  or
                      in  object  space  length unit, to use when
                      the   sampling    method    is    set    to
                      <B>GLU_PATH_LENGTH</B>  or <B>GLU_OBJECT_PATH_LENGTH</B>.
                      The NURBS code is conservative when render-
                      ing  a  curve  or  surface,  so  the actual
                      length can be somewhat shorter. The initial
                      value is 50.0 pixels.

       <B>GLU_PARAMETRIC_TOLERANCE</B>
                      Specifies  the  maximum distance, in pixels
                      or in object space length unit, to use when
                      the sampling method is <B>GLU_PARAMETRIC_ERROR</B>
                      or <B>GLU_OBJECT_PARAMETRIC_ERROR</B>.   The  ini-
                      tial value is 0.5.

       <B>GLU_U_STEP</B>     Specifies  the  number of sample points per
                      unit length taken along the <I>u</I> axis in para-
                      metric   coordinates.  It  is  needed  when
                      <B>GLU_SAMPLING_METHOD</B>     is      set      to
                      <B>GLU_DOMAIN_DISTANCE</B>.   The initial value is
                      100.

       <B>GLU_V_STEP</B>     Specifies the number of sample  points  per
                      rendered  as  a set of polygons. When <I>value</I>
                      is set to  <B>GLU_OUTLINE_POLYGON</B>,  the  NURBS
                      library  draws  only  the  outlines  of the
                      polygons  created  by  tessellation.   When
                      <I>value</I>  is set to <B>GLU_OUTLINE_PATCH</B> just the
                      outlines of patches and trim curves defined
                      by the user are drawn.

                      When    <B>GLU_NURBS_MODE</B>   is   set   to   be
                      <B>GLU_NURBS_TESSELLATOR</B>, <I>value</I> defines how  a
                      NURBS  surface should be tessellated.  When
                      <B>GLU_DISPLAY_MODE</B>  is  set  to  <B>GLU_FILL</B>  or
                      <B>GLU_OUTLINE_POLYGON</B>,  the  NURBS surface is
                      tessellated into OpenGL triangle primitives
                      which  can be retrieved back  through call-
                      back functions. If <B>GLU_DISPLAY_MODE</B> is  set
                      to  <B>GLU_OUTLINE_PATCH</B>, only the outlines of
                      the patches and trim curves  are  generated
                      as  a  sequence of line strips which can be
                      retrieved back through callback  functions.

                      The initial value is <B>GLU_FILL</B>.

       <B>GLU_CULLING</B>    <I>value</I>  is a boolean value that, when set to
                      <B>GL_TRUE</B>,  indicates  that  a  NURBS   curve
                      should  be  discarded prior to tessellation
                      if its control points lie outside the  cur-
                      rent   viewport.   The   initial  value  is
                      <B>GL_FALSE</B>.

       <B>GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX</B>
                      <I>value</I> is  a  boolean  value.  When  set  to
                      <B>GL_TRUE</B>,  the NURBS code downloads the pro-
                      jection matrix, the modelview  matrix,  and
                      the  viewport from the GL server to compute
                      sampling  and  culling  matrices  for  each
                      NURBS  curve that is rendered. Sampling and
                      culling matrices are required to  determine
                      the  tessellation  of  a NURBS surface into
                      line segments or polygons  and  to  cull  a
                      NURBS  surface if it lies outside the view-
                      port.

                      If this mode is set to <B>GL_FALSE</B>,  then  the
                      program   needs  to  provide  a  projection
                      matrix, a modelview matrix, and a  viewport
                      for  the NURBS renderer to use to construct
                      sampling and culling matrices.  This can be
                      done with the <B>gluLoadSamplingMatrices</B> func-
                      tion.   This  mode  is  initially  set   to
                      <B>GL_TRUE</B>.    Changing  it  from  <B>GL_TRUE</B>  to
                      <B>GL_FALSE</B> does not affect the  sampling  and

       <B>gluGetString</B> can be used to determine the GLU version.

       <B>GLU_NURBS_MODE</B>  is only availble if the GLU version is 1.3
       or greater.

       The <B>GLU_OBJECT_PATH_LENGTH</B> and <B>GLU_OBJECT_PARAMETRIC_ERROR</B>
       values  for  the  <B>GLU_SAMPLING_METHOD</B>  property  are  only
       available if the GLU version is 1.3 or greater.
