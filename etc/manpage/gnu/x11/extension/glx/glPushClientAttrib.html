<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Specifies  a mask that indicates which attributes
                to save.  Values for _param1 are listed below.

<H2>C SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glPushClientAttrib</B> takes one argument, a mask  that  indi-
       cates  which  groups  of client-state variables to save on
       the client attribute stack.  Symbolic constants  are  used
       to  set  bits  in  the mask.  <B>_param1(1)</B> is typically con-
       structed by OR'ing several of  these  constants  together.
       The  special mask <B>GL_CLIENT_ALL_ATTRIB_BITS</B> can be used to
       save all stackable client state.

       The symbolic mask constants and their associated GL client
       state  are  as  follows  (the  second  column  lists which
       attributes are saved):

       <B>GL_CLIENT_PIXEL_STORE_BIT</B>     Pixel storage modes
       <B>GL_CLIENT_VERTEX_ARRAY_BIT</B>    Vertex arrays (and enables)

       <B>glPopClientAttrib</B> restores the values of the  client-state
       variables  saved  with the last <B>glPushClientAttrib</B>.  Those
       not saved are left unchanged.

       It is an error to  push  attributes  onto  a  full  client
       attribute  stack, or to pop attributes off an empty stack.
       In either case, the error flag is set, and no other change
       is made to GL state.

       Initially, the client attribute stack is empty.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>glPushClientAttrib</B>  is available only if the GL version is
       1.1 or greater.

       Not all values for GL client state can  be  saved  on  the
       attribute  stack.   For example, select and feedback state
       cannot be saved.

       The depth of the attribute stack depends on the  implemen-
       tation, but it must be at least 16.

       Use <B>glPushAttrib</B> and <B>glPopAttrib</B> to push and restore state
       which is kept on the server. Only pixel storage modes  and
       vertex   array   state  may  be  pushed  and  popped  with
       <B>glPushClientAttrib</B> and <B>glPopClientAttrib</B>.
