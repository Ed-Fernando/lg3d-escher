       <B>glXCreateContext</B> - create a new GLX rendering context



</PRE>
<H2>C SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       GLXContext <B>glXCreateContext</B>( Display <I>*dpy</I>,
                                    XVisualInfo <I>*vis</I>,
                                    GLXContext <I>shareList</I>,

</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>dpy</I>        Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>vis</I>        Specifies  the  visual  that  defines the frame
                  buffer resources  available  to  the  rendering
                  context.   It  is  a  pointer to an <B>XVisualInfo</B>
                  structure, not a visual ID or a  pointer  to  a
                  <B>Visual</B>.

       <I>shareList</I>  Specifies  the context with which to share dis-
                  play lists.  <B>NULL</B> indicates that no sharing  is
                  to take place.

       <I>direct</I>     Specifies  whether rendering is to be done with
                  a direct connection to the graphics  system  if
                  possible  (<B>True</B>)  or  through  the  X server (-
                  <B>False</B>).


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glXCreateContext</B>  creates  a  GLX  rendering  context  and
       returns  its  handle.   This context can be used to render
       into both windows and GLX  pixmaps.   If  <B>glXCreateContext</B>
       fails to create a rendering context, <B>NULL</B> is returned.

       If <I>direct</I> is <B>True</B>, then a direct rendering context is cre-
       ated if the implementation supports direct  rendering,  if
       the  connection  is to an X server that is local, and if a
       direct rendering context is available. (An  implementation
       may  return  an indirect context when <I>direct</I> is <B>True</B>).  If
       <I>direct</I> is <B>False</B>, then a  rendering  context  that  renders
       through  the X server is always created.  Direct rendering
       provides a performance advantage in some  implementations.
       However,  direct  rendering contexts cannot be shared out-
       side a single process, and they may be unable to render to
       GLX pixmaps.

       If  <I>shareList</I>  is  not <B>NULL</B>, then all display-list indexes
       and definitions are shared by context <I>shareList</I> and by the
       newly  created  context.   An arbitrary number of contexts
       can share a single display-list space.  However, all  ren-
       dering  contexts  that  share  a single display-list space
       must themselves exist in the same address space.  Two ren-

       A  <I>process</I>  is a single execution environment, implemented
       in a single address  space,  consisting  of  one  or  more
       threads.

       A <I>thread</I> is one of a set of subprocesses that share a sin-
       gle address space, but maintain separate program counters,
       stack  spaces,  and  other  related global data.  A <I>thread</I>
       that is the only member of its subprocess group is equiva-
       lent to a <I>process</I>.

       It  may  not  be possible to render to a GLX pixmap with a
       direct rendering context.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>NULL</B> is returned if execution fails on the client side.

       <B>BadMatch</B> is generated if the context to be  created  would
       not  share  the address space or the screen of the context
       specified by <I>shareList</I>.

       <B>BadValue</B> is generated if <I>vis</I> is not a  valid  visual  (for
       example,  if a particular GLX implementation does not sup-
       port it).

       <B>GLXBadContext</B> is generated if <I>shareList</I> is not a GLX  con-
       text and is not <B>NULL</B>.

       <B>BadAlloc</B>  is  generated if the server does not have enough
       resources to allocate the new context.
