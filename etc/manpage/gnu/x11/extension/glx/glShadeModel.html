       _param1  Specifies a symbolic value representing a shading
                technique.   Accepted  values  are  <B>GL_FLAT</B>   and
                <B>GL_SMOOTH</B>.  The initial value is <B>GL_SMOOTH</B>.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       GL  primitives  can  have  either  flat or smooth shading.
       Smooth shading, the default, causes the computed colors of
       vertices  to  be  interpolated as the primitive is raster-
       ized, typically assigning different colors to each result-
       ing  pixel  fragment.   Flat  shading selects the computed
       color of just one vertex and assigns it to all  the  pixel
       fragments generated by rasterizing a single primitive.  In
       either case, the computed color of a vertex is the  result
       of  lighting  if lighting is enabled, or it is the current
       color at the time the vertex was specified if lighting  is
       disabled.

       Flat  and smooth shading are indistinguishable for points.
       Starting when <B>glBegin</B> is issued and counting vertices  and
       primitives from 1, the GL gives each flat-shaded line seg-
       ment <I>i</I> the computed color of vertex <I>i</I>+1, its  second  ver-
       tex.   Counting  similarly from 1, the GL gives each flat-
       shaded polygon the computed color of the vertex listed  in
       the  following  table.  This is the last vertex to specify
       the polygon in all cases except single polygons, where the
       first vertex specifies the flat-shaded color.

       Flat and smooth shading are specified by <B>glShadeModel</B> with
       _param1 set to <B>GL_FLAT</B> and <B>GL_SMOOTH</B>, respectively.

<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B> is generated if _param1 is any value other
       than <B>GL_FLAT</B> or <B>GL_SMOOTH</B>.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>  is generated if <B>glShadeModel</B> is exe-
       cuted between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the correspond-
