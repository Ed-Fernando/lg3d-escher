<H2>C SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>

<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Bitwise  OR of masks that indicate the buffers to
                be    cleared.     The     four     masks     are
                <B>GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</B>,         <B>GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</B>,
                <B>GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT</B>, and <B>GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glClear</B> sets the bitplane area of  the  window  to  values
       previously   selected   by   <B>glClearColor</B>,   <B>glClearIndex</B>,
       <B>glClearDepth</B>, <B>glClearStencil</B>, and <B>glClearAccum</B>.   Multiple
       color  buffers  can be cleared simultaneously by selecting
       more than one buffer at a time using <B>glDrawBuffer</B>.

       The pixel ownership test, the scissor test, dithering, and
       the  buffer  writemasks  affect  the operation of <B>glClear</B>.
       The scissor box bounds the cleared  region.   Alpha  func-
       tion,  blend function, logical operation, stenciling, tex-
       ture mapping, and depth-buffering are ignored by  <B>glClear</B>.

       <B>glClear</B>  takes a single argument that is the bitwise OR of
       several values indicating which buffer is to be cleared.

       The values are as follows:

       <B>GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</B>         Indicates  the  buffers   cur-
                                   rently enabled for color writ-
                                   ing.

       <B>GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</B>         Indicates the depth buffer.

       <B>GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT</B>         Indicates   the   accumulation
                                   buffer.

       <B>GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT</B>       Indicates  the stencil buffer.

       The value to which each buffer is cleared depends  on  the
       setting of the clear value for that buffer.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       If  a  buffer  is  not present, then a <B>glClear</B> directed at
       that buffer has no effect.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_VALUE</B> is generated if any bit  other  than  the
       four defined bits is set in _param1.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>  is  generated if <B>glClear</B> is executed
       between the execution of  <B>glBegin</B>  and  the  corresponding


                                                                1
