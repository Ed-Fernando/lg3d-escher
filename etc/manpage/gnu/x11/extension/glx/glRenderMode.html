<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       _param1  Specifies  the  rasterization mode.  Three values
                are   accepted:   <B>GL_RENDER</B>,    <B>GL_SELECT</B>,    and
                <B>GL_FEEDBACK</B>.  The initial value is <B>GL_RENDER</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glRenderMode</B>  sets  the  rasterization mode.  It takes one
       argument, _param1, which can assume one  of  three  prede-
       fined values:

       <B>GL_RENDER</B>       Render  mode.  Primitives  are rasterized,
                       producing pixel fragments, which are writ-
                       ten  into  the  frame buffer.  This is the
                       normal mode and also the default mode.

       <B>GL_SELECT</B>       Selection mode.  No  pixel  fragments  are
                       produced,  and  no  change  to  the  frame
                       buffer  contents  is  made.   Instead,   a
                       record  of  the  names  of primitives that
                       would have been drawn if the  render  mode
                       had been <B>GL_RENDER</B> is returned in a select
                       buffer,  which  must   be   created   (see
                       <B>glSelectBuffer</B>)  before  selection mode is
                       entered.

       <B>GL_FEEDBACK</B>     Feedback mode.   No  pixel  fragments  are
                       produced,  and  no  change  to  the  frame
                       buffer contents  is  made.   Instead,  the
                       coordinates  and  attributes  of  vertices
                       that would have been drawn if  the  render
                       mode  had  been <B>GL_RENDER</B> is returned in a
                       feedback buffer,  which  must  be  created
                       (see   <B>glFeedbackBuffer</B>)  before  feedback
                       mode is entered.

       The return value of <B>glRenderMode</B> is determined by the ren-
       der  mode  at the time <B>glRenderMode</B> is called, rather than
       by _param1.  The values  returned  for  the  three  render
       modes are as follows:

       <B>GL_RENDER</B>       0.

       <B>GL_SELECT</B>       The  number  of hit records transferred to
                       the select buffer.

       <B>GL_FEEDBACK</B>     The number of values (not vertices) trans-
                       ferred to the feedback buffer.

       <B>glRenderMode</B>  is  called  with  argument  <B>GL_SELECT</B> before
       <B>glSelectBuffer</B> is called at least once.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B> is generated if  <B>glFeedbackBuffer</B>  is
       called  while  the  render  mode  is  <B>GL_FEEDBACK</B>,  or  if
       <B>glRenderMode</B> is called with  argument  <B>GL_FEEDBACK</B>  before
       <B>glFeedbackBuffer</B> is called at least once.

       <B>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</B>  is generated if <B>glRenderMode</B> is exe-
       cuted between the execution of <B>glBegin</B> and the correspond-
       ing execution of <B>glEnd</B>.
