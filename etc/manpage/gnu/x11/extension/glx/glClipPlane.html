       _param1  Specifies  which  clipping  plane  is being posi-
                tioned.    Symbolic    names    of    the    form
                <B>GL_CLIP_PLANE</B><I>i</I>,  where  <I>i</I> is an integer between 0
                and <B>GL_MAX_CLIP_PLANES</B>-1, are accepted.

       _param2  Specifies the address of an array of four double-
                precision  floating-point  values.   These values
                are interpreted as a plane equation.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Geometry is always clipped against  the  boundaries  of  a
       six-plane  frustum in <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, and <I>z</I>.  <B>glClipPlane</B> allows the
       specification of additional planes, not  necessarily  per-
       pendicular to the <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, or <I>z</I> axis, against which all geom-
       etry is clipped.  To determine the maximum number of addi-
       tional  clipping  planes, call <B>glGetIntegerv</B> with argument
       <B>GL_MAX_CLIP_PLANES</B>. All implementations support  at  least
       six  such clipping planes.  Because the resulting clipping
       region is the intersection of the defined half-spaces,  it
       is always convex.

       <B>glClipPlane</B>  specifies a half-space using a four-component
       plane equation.  When <B>glClipPlane</B> is  called,  _param2  is
       transformed  by  the  inverse  of the modelview matrix and
       stored  in  the  resulting  eye  coordinates.   Subsequent
       changes  to  the  modelview  matrix  have no effect on the
       stored plane-equation components.  If the dot  product  of
       the  eye  coordinates  of  a  vertex with the stored plane
       equation components is positive or zero, the vertex is  <I>in</I>
       with  respect  to  that  clipping plane.  Otherwise, it is
       <I>out</I>.

       To enable and disable clipping planes, call  <B>glEnable</B>  and
       <B>glDisable</B> with the argument <B>GL_CLIP_PLANE</B><I>i</I>, where <I>i</I> is the
       plane number.

       All clipping planes are initially defined as (0, 0, 0,  0)
       in eye coordinates and are disabled.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       It    is   always   the   case   that   <B>GL_CLIP_PLANE</B><I>i</I>   =
       <B>GL_CLIP_PLANE0</B>+<I>i</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>GL_INVALID_ENUM</B> is generated if _param1 is not an accepted
       value.
