       XKeymapEvent - KeymapNotify event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>KeymapNotify</I> events contains:

       /* generated on EnterWindow and FocusIn when KeymapState selected */
       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* KeymapNotify */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;
            char key_vector[32];
       } XKeymapEvent;

       When you receive this event, the structure members are set
       as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The window member is not used but is present to aid some
       toolkits.  The key_vector member is set to the bit vector
       of the keyboard.  Each bit set to 1 indicates that the
       corresponding key is currently pressed.  The vector is
       represented as 32 bytes.  Byte N (from 0) contains the
       bits for keys 8N to 8N + 7 with the least significant bit
       in the byte representing key 8N.
