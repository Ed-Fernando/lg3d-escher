       XFocusChangeEvent - FocusIn and FocusOut event structure


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The structure for <I>FocusIn</I> and <I>FocusOut</I> events contains:

       typedef struct {
            int type;                /* FocusIn or FocusOut */
            unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
            Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
            Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
            Window window;           /* window of event */
            int mode;                /* NotifyNormal, NotifyGrab, NotifyUngrab */
            int detail;
                                     /*
                                     * NotifyAncestor, NotifyVirtual, NotifyInferior,
                                     * NotifyNonlinear,NotifyNonlinearVirtual, NotifyPointer,
                                     * NotifyPointerRoot, NotifyDetailNone
                                     */
       } XFocusChangeEvent;
       typedef XFocusChangeEvent XFocusInEvent;
       typedef XFocusChangeEvent XFocusOutEvent;

       When you receive these events, the structure members are
       set as follows.

       The type member is set to the event type constant name
       that uniquely identifies it.  For example, when the X
       server reports a <I>GraphicsExpose</I> event to a client applica-
       tion, it sends an <I>XGraphicsExposeEvent</I> structure with the
       type member set to <I>GraphicsExpose</I>.  The display member is
       set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
       The send_event member is set to <I>True</I> if the event came
       from a <I>SendEvent</I> protocol request.  The serial member is
       set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
       expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
       32-bit value.  The window member is set to the window that
       is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

       The window member is set to the window on which the
       <I>FocusIn</I> or <I>FocusOut</I> event was generated.  This is the win-
       dow used by the X server to report the event.  The mode
       member is set to indicate whether the focus events are
       normal focus events, focus events while grabbed, focus
       events when a grab activates, or focus events when a grab
       deactivates.  The X server can set the mode member to
       <I>NotifyNormal</I>, <I>NotifyWhileGrabbed</I>, <I>NotifyGrab</I>, or
       <I>NotifyUngrab</I>.

       All <I>FocusOut</I> events caused by a window unmap are generated
       after any <I>UnmapNotify</I> event; however, the X protocol does
       not constrain the ordering of <I>FocusOut</I> events with respect
       to generated <I>EnterNotify</I>, <I>LeaveNotify</I>, <I>VisibilityNotify</I>,
       rorEvent(3X11), XExposeEvent(3X11), XGraphicsEx-
       poseEvent(3X11), XGravityEvent(3X11), XKeymapEvent(3X11),
       XMapEvent(3X11), XMapRequestEvent(3X11), XProper-
       tyEvent(3X11), XReparentEvent(3X11), XResiz-
       eRequestEvent(3X11), XSelectionClearEvent(3X11), XSelec-
       tionEvent(3X11), XSelectionRequestEvent(3X11), XUn-
       mapEvent(3X11), XVisibilityEvent(3X11)
