<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2><PRE>
       <I>confine</I><B>_</B><I>to</I>
                 Specifies the window to confine the pointer in
                 or <I>None</I>.

       <I>cursor</I>    Specifies the cursor that is to be displayed
                 during the grab or <I>None</I>.

       <I>display</I>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>event</I><B>_</B><I>mask</I>
                 Specifies which pointer events are reported to
                 the client.  The mask is the bitwise inclusive
                 OR of the valid pointer event mask bits.

       <I>grab</I><B>_</B><I>window</I>
                 Specifies the grab window.

       <I>keyboard</I><B>_</B><I>mode</I>
                 Specifies further processing of keyboard events.
                 You can pass <I>GrabModeSync</I> or <I>GrabModeAsync</I>.

       <I>owner</I><B>_</B><I>events</I>
                 Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether
                 the pointer events are to be reported as usual

       grabbing client.  <I>XGrabPointer</I> overrides any active
       pointer grab by this client.  If owner_events is <I>False</I>,
       all generated pointer events are reported with respect to
       grab_window and are reported only if selected by
       event_mask.  If owner_events is <I>True</I> and if a generated
       pointer event would normally be reported to this client,
       it is reported as usual.  Otherwise, the event is reported
       with respect to the grab_window and is reported only if
       selected by event_mask.  For either value of owner_events,
       unreported events are discarded.

       If the pointer_mode is <I>GrabModeAsync</I>, pointer event pro-
       cessing continues as usual.  If the pointer is currently
       frozen by this client, the processing of events for the
       pointer is resumed.  If the pointer_mode is <I>GrabModeSync</I>,
       the state of the pointer, as seen by client applications,
       appears to freeze, and the X server generates no further
       pointer events until the grabbing client calls <I>XAllow-</I>
       <I>Events</I> or until the pointer grab is released.  Actual
       pointer changes are not lost while the pointer is frozen;
       they are simply queued in the server for later processing.

       If the keyboard_mode is <I>GrabModeAsync</I>, keyboard event pro-
       cessing is unaffected by activation of the grab.  If the
       keyboard_mode is <I>GrabModeSync</I>, the state of the keyboard,
       as seen by client applications, appears to freeze, and the
       X server generates no further keyboard events until the
       grabbing client calls <I>XAllowEvents</I> or until the pointer
       grab is released.  Actual keyboard changes are not lost
       while the pointer is frozen; they are simply queued in the
       server for later processing.

       If a cursor is specified, it is displayed regardless of
       what window the pointer is in.  If <I>None</I> is specified, the
       normal cursor for that window is displayed when the
       pointer is in grab_window or one of its subwindows; other-
       wise, the cursor for grab_window is displayed.

       If a confine_to window is specified, the pointer is
       restricted to stay contained in that window.  The con-
       fine_to window need have no relationship to the grab_win-
       dow.  If the pointer is not initially in the confine_to
       window, it is warped automatically to the closest edge
       just before the grab activates and enter/leave events are
       generated as usual.  If the confine_to window is subse-
       quently reconfigured, the pointer is warped automatically,
       as necessary, to keep it contained in the window.

       The time argument allows you to avoid certain circum-
       stances that come up if applications take a long time to
       respond or if there are long network delays.  Consider a
       situation where you have two applications, both of which
       <I>AlreadyGrabbed</I>.  If the pointer is frozen by an active
       grab of another client, it fails and returns <I>GrabFrozen</I>.
       If the specified time is earlier than the last-pointer-
       grab time or later than the current X server time, it
       fails and returns <I>GrabInvalidTime</I>.  Otherwise, the last-
       pointer-grab time is set to the specified time (<I>Current-</I>
       <I>Time</I> is replaced by the current X server time).

       <I>XGrabPointer</I> can generate <I>BadCursor</I>, <I>BadValue</I>, and <I>BadWin-</I>
       <I>dow</I> errors.

       The <I>XUngrabPointer</I> function releases the pointer and any
       queued events if this client has actively grabbed the
       pointer from <I>XGrabPointer</I>, <I>XGrabButton</I>, or from a normal
       button press.  <I>XUngrabPointer</I> does not release the pointer
       if the specified time is earlier than the last-pointer-
       grab time or is later than the current X server time.  It
       also generates <I>EnterNotify</I> and <I>LeaveNotify</I> events.  The X
       server performs an <I>UngrabPointer</I> request automatically if
       the event window or confine_to window for an active
       pointer grab becomes not viewable or if window reconfigu-
       ration causes the confine_to window to lie completely out-
       side the boundaries of the root window.

       The <I>XChangeActivePointerGrab</I> function changes the speci-
       fied dynamic parameters if the pointer is actively grabbed
       by the client and if the specified time is no earlier than
       the last-pointer-grab time and no later than the current X
       server time.  This function has no effect on the passive
       parameters of a <I>XGrabButton</I>.  The interpretation of
       event_mask and cursor is the same as described in
       <I>XGrabPointer</I>.

       <I>XChangeActivePointerGrab</I> can generate a <I>BadCursor</I> and <I>Bad-</I>
       <I>Value</I> error.


</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       <I>BadCursor</I> A value for a Cursor argument does not name a
                 defined Cursor.

       <I>BadValue</I>  Some numeric value falls outside the range of
                 values accepted by the request.  Unless a spe-
                 cific range is specified for an argument, the
                 full range defined by the argument's type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of
                 alternatives can generate this error.

       <I>BadWindow</I> A value for a Window argument does not name a
                 defined Window.
