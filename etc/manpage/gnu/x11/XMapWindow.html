       XMapWindow, XMapRaised, XMapSubwindows - map windows


</PRE>
<H2>SYNTAX</H2><PRE>
       XMapWindow(<I>display</I>, <I>w</I>)
             Display *<I>display</I>;
             Window <I>w</I>;

       XMapRaised(<I>display</I>, <I>w</I>)
             Display *<I>display</I>;
             Window <I>w</I>;

       XMapSubwindows(<I>display</I>, <I>w</I>)
             Display *<I>display</I>;
             Window <I>w</I>;


</PRE>
<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2><PRE>
       <I>display</I>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>w</I>         Specifies the window.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <I>XMapWindow</I> function maps the window and all of its
       subwindows that have had map requests.  Mapping a window
       that has an unmapped ancestor does not display the window
       but marks it as eligible for display when the ancestor
       becomes mapped.  Such a window is called unviewable.  When
       all its ancestors are mapped, the window becomes viewable
       and will be visible on the screen if it is not obscured by
       another window.  This function has no effect if the window
       is already mapped.

       If the override-redirect of the window is <I>False</I> and if
       some other client has selected <I>SubstructureRedirectMask</I> on
       the parent window, then the X server generates a <I>MapRe-</I>
       <I>quest</I> event, and the <I>XMapWindow</I> function does not map the
       window.  Otherwise, the window is mapped, and the X server
       generates a <I>MapNotify</I> event.

       If the window becomes viewable and no earlier contents for
       it are remembered, the X server tiles the window with its
       background.  If the window's background is undefined, the
       existing screen contents are not altered, and the X server
       generates zero or more <I>Expose</I> events.  If backing-store
       was maintained while the window was unmapped, no <I>Expose</I>
       events are generated.  If backing-store will now be main-
       tained, a full-window exposure is always generated.  Oth-
       erwise, only visible regions may be reported.  Similar
       tiling and exposure take place for any newly viewable
       inferiors.

       If the window is an <I>InputOutput</I> window, <I>XMapWindow</I> gener-
       ates <I>Expose</I> events on each <I>InputOutput</I> window that it
       <I>dow</I> in that it maps the window and all of its subwindows
       that have had map requests.  However, it also raises the
       specified window to the top of the stack.

       <I>XMapRaised</I> can generate a <I>BadWindow</I> error.

       The <I>XMapSubwindows</I> function maps all subwindows for a
       specified window in top-to-bottom stacking order.  The X
       server generates <I>Expose</I> events on each newly displayed
       window.  This may be much more efficient than mapping many
       windows one at a time because the server needs to perform
       much of the work only once, for all of the windows, rather
       than for each window.

       <I>XMapSubwindows</I> can generate a <I>BadWindow</I> error.


</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       <I>BadWindow</I> A value for a Window argument does not name a
                 defined Window.
