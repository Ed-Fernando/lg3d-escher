       XAllocWMHints, XSetWMHints, XGetWMHints, XWMHints - allo-
       cate window manager hints structure and set or read a win-
       dow's WM_HINTS property


</PRE>
<H2>SYNTAX</H2><PRE>
       XWMHints *XAllocWMHints()

       XSetWMHints(<I>display</I>, <I>w</I>, <I>wmhints</I>)
             Display *<I>display</I>;

       XWMHints *XGetWMHints(<I>display</I>, <I>w</I>)

             Window <I>w</I>;


</PRE>
<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2><PRE>
       <I>display</I>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>w</I>         Specifies the window.

       <I>wmhints</I>   Specifies the <I>XWMHints</I> structure to be used.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <I>XAllocWMHints</I> function allocates and returns a pointer
       to a <I>XWMHints</I> structure.  Note that all fields in the
       <I>XWMHints</I> structure are initially set to zero.  If insuffi-
       cient memory is available, <I>XAllocWMHints</I> returns NULL.  To
       free the memory allocated to this structure, use <I>XFree</I>.

       The <I>XSetWMHints</I> function sets the window manager hints
       that include icon information and location, the initial
       state of the window, and whether the application relies on
       the window manager to get keyboard input.

       <I>XSetWMHints</I> can generate <I>BadAlloc</I> and <I>BadWindow</I> errors.

       The <I>XGetWMHints</I> function reads the window manager hints
       and returns NULL if no WM_HINTS property was set on the
       window or returns a pointer to a <I>XWMHints</I> structure if it
       succeeds.  When finished with the data, free the space
       used for it by calling <I>XFree</I>.

       <I>XGetWMHints</I> can generate a <I>BadWindow</I> error.


</PRE>
<H2>PROPERTIES</H2><PRE>
       WM_HINTS  Additional hints set by the client for use by
                 the window manager.  The C type of this property
                 is <I>XWMHints</I>.

<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
                                             IconWindowHint|IconPosi-
                                             tionHint|

                                             GroupHint)
       /* Values */

       typedef struct {
            long flags;         /* marks which fields in this structure are defined */
            Bool input;         /* does this application rely on the window manager to
                                get keyboard input? */
            int initial_state;  /* see below */
            Pixmap icon_pixmap; /* pixmap to be used as icon */
            Window icon_window; /* window to be used as icon */
            int icon_x, icon_y; /* initial position of icon */
            Pixmap icon_mask;   /* pixmap to be used as mask for icon_pixmap */
            XID window_group;   /* id of related window group */
            /* this structure may be extended in the future */
       } XWMHints;

       The input member is used to communicate to the window man-
       ager the input focus model used by the application.
       Applications that expect input but never explicitly set
       focus to any of their subwindows (that is, use the push
       model of focus management), such as X Version 10 style
       applications that use real-estate driven focus, should set
       this member to <I>True</I>.  Similarly, applications that set
       input focus to their subwindows only when it is given to
       their top-level window by a window manager should also set
       this member to <I>True</I>.  Applications that manage their own
       input focus by explicitly setting focus to one of their
       subwindows whenever they want keyboard input (that is, use
       the pull model of focus management) should set this member
       to <I>False</I>.  Applications that never expect any keyboard
       input also should set this member to <I>False</I>.

       Pull model window managers should make it possible for
       push model applications to get input by setting input
       focus to the top-level windows of applications whose input
       member is <I>True</I>.  Push model window managers should make
       sure that pull model applications do not break them by
       resetting input focus to <I>PointerRoot</I> when it is appropri-
       ate (for example, whenever an application whose input mem-
       ber is <I>False</I> sets input focus to one of its subwindows).

       The definitions for the initial_state flag are:
       #define   <I>WithdrawnState</I>         0
       #define   <I>NormalState</I>            1    /* most applications start
                                             this way */
       #define   <I>IconicState</I>            3    /* application wants to
                                             start as an icon */
       The icon_mask specifies which pixels of the icon_pixmap
       should be used as the icon.  This allows for nonrectangu-
       to this window while this flag is set.  The client must
       provide some means by which the user can cause the urgency
       flag to be cleared (either mitigating the condition that
       made the window urgent or merely shutting off the alarm)
       or the window to be withdrawn.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       <I>BadAlloc</I>  The server failed to allocate the requested
                 resource or server memory.

       <I>BadWindow</I> A value for a Window argument does not name a
                 defined Window.
