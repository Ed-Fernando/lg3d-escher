</PRE>
<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2><PRE>
       <I>d</I>         Specifies the drawable.

       <I>display</I>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>gc</I>        Specifies the GC.

       <I>items</I>     Specifies an array of text items.

       <I>nitems</I>    Specifies the number of text items in the array.

       <I>x</I>
       <I>y</I>         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are rela-
                 tive to the origin of the specified drawable and
                 define the origin of the first character.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <I>XDrawText16</I> function is similar to <I>XDrawText</I> except
       that it uses 2-byte or 16-bit characters.  Both functions
       allow complex spacing and font shifts between counted
       strings.

       Each text item is processed in turn.  A font member other
       than <I>None</I> in an item causes the font to be stored in the
       GC and used for subsequent text.  A text element delta
       specifies an additional change in the position along the x
       axis before the string is drawn.  The delta is always
       added to the character origin and is not dependent on any
       characteristics of the font.  Each character image, as
       defined by the font in the GC, is treated as an additional
       mask for a fill operation on the drawable.  The drawable
       is modified only where the font character has a bit set to
       <I>BadFont</I>, <I>BadGC</I>, and <I>BadMatch</I> errors.


</PRE>
<H2>STRUCTURES</H2><PRE>
       The <I>XTextItem</I> and <I>XTextItem16</I> structures contain:

       typedef struct {
            char *chars;             /* pointer to string */
            int nchars;              /* number of characters */
            int delta;               /* delta between strings */
            Font font;               /* Font to print it in, None don't change */
       } XTextItem;

       typedef struct {
            XChar2b *chars;          /* pointer to two-byte characters */
            int nchars;              /* number of characters */
            int delta;               /* delta between strings */
            Font font;               /* font to print it in, None don't change */
       } XTextItem16;

       If the font member is not <I>None</I>, the font is changed before
       printing and also is stored in the GC.  If an error was
       generated during text drawing, the previous items may have
       been drawn.  The baseline of the characters are drawn
       starting at the x and y coordinates that you pass in the
       text drawing functions.

       For example, consider the background rectangle drawn by
       <I>XDrawImageString</I>.  If you want the upper-left corner of
       the background rectangle to be at pixel coordinate (x,y),
       pass the (x,y + ascent) as the baseline origin coordinates
       to the text functions.  The ascent is the font ascent, as
       given in the <I>XFontStruct</I> structure.  If you want the
       lower-left corner of the background rectangle to be at
       pixel coordinate (x,y), pass the (x,y - descent + 1) as
       the baseline origin coordinates to the text functions.
       The descent is the font descent, as given in the
       <I>XFontStruct</I> structure.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       <I>BadDrawable</I>
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a
                 defined Window or Pixmap.

       <I>BadFont</I>   A value for a Font or GContext argument does not
                 name a defined Font.

       <I>BadGC</I>     A value for a GContext argument does not name a
                 defined GContext.

       <I>BadMatch</I>  An <I>InputOnly</I> window is used as a Drawable.
