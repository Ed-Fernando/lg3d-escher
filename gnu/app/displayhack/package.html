Provide display hacks.


<h3>Name</h3>

From <a href=
"http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/display-hack.html">
The Jargon Lexicon</a>:

<blockquote>
A program with the same approximate purpose as a kaleidoscope: to make
pretty pictures. Famous display hacks include <b>munching squares</b>,
<b>smoking clover</b>, the BSD Unix <code>rain(6)</code> program,
<code>worms(6)</code> on miscellaneous Unixes, and the <b>X</b>
<code>kaleid(1)</code> program. Display hacks can also be implemented
by creating text files containing numerous escape sequences for
interpretation by a video terminal; one notable example displayed, on
any VT100, a Christmas tree with twinkling lights and a toy train
circling its base. The <b>hack value</b> of a display hack is
proportional to the esthetic value of the images times the cleverness
of the algorithm divided by the size of the code. Syn. 
<b>psychedelicware</b>.
